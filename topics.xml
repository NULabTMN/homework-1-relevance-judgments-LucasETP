        <text>It
          made me morose and envious, but 'what
          Btarted the craze to kill was a lecture I
          heard some little time ago by Emma Gold
          man. She was In Cleveland and .1 and
          other anarchists went to hear -her," She
          set me on Are,
          "Her doctrine that all rulers should be,
          exterminated was what set me to thinking,
          so that my head nearly split with the pain,
          lilss Goldman's words went right through
          me, and when I left the lecture I. had made
          up my mind that I would have to do some
          thing heroic for the cause I loved.
          resolution to shoot tub
          president formed tuesday. Yesterday morning I went again to tie
          Exposition grounds. Emma Goldman's
          speech still burning, me up. I waited near
          the central entrance for the President,
          who was to board his. special train from
          that gate, but the police allowed nobody
          but the President's party to pass where the
          train waited, so'I stayed at the grounds all
          day waiting.</text>

          Kmma Goldman had a friend In St. Louis

          do not know where from". She occupied
          Dold's" former room when here Friday.
          DoM left St Louis In July for Pittsburg,

          man, the "Anarchist Queen," undoi
          whose red banner Czolgosz clilms ho
          stands, whoso words he claims fired his
          heart and brain to attempt the assas
          sination of President McKinley, was
          arrested here shortly before noon to
          day. She disclaimed all but the slightest
          acquaintance with the President's as
          sistant. She denied absolutely thatshe
          or any anarchist phe knew was Impli
          cated in any plot to kill tho President.
          She said she believed that Czolgosz
          acted entirely on his own responsibility
          and that ho never claimed to have
          been Inspired by her ns he is quoted as
          affirming. Tho President, she averred,
          with a yawn wns an insignificant be;
          ing to her, a more human atom whose
          life or death was n matter of sum erne
          indifference to her or to any other
          anarchist.
          Czogosz act was foolish, yet, she de
          clared, it probably had Its inspiration
          In the misery which the Pole had seen
          about him. Violence, she said, Is not
          a tenet in the faith of the anarchist,,
          and she had not advocated It In Cleve
          land where Czolgosz said he heard her,
          nor clsewhcie.
          Miss Goldman anlved heic Sunday
          morning from St. Louis Sho told amid
          laughter of her captuie today. In her
          convcisation only once did she break
          down completely. That was when
          Captain Schuettler led her fiom the of
          fice of Chief of Police O'Neill tothe cab
          waiting to convey her to the woman's
          annex at the Harrison stieet police
          station. For n moment sho cried, but
          tho next moment this condition of dis
          tress was over. She said her purpose
          in coming here had been to help three
          anaichists arrested here seveial days
          ago. Sho Intended to give herself up
          to the police but delayed it until the
          polce had taken tho matter In their
          own hands. She is held on a warrant
          sworn out by Captain Colleraln, charg
          ing her- with conspiracy to murder tho
          President. As her co-conspirators aro
          named the anarchists already in jail
          here. She will bo taken befoio a mag
          Istrato tomorrow. It Is expected tha'
          the city will ask for a continuance of
          tho case pending advices fiom Buffalo.
          "I shall insist upon an Immediate
          hearing," sho Baid. "They want mo
          to go to New York without requisition
          papers, but I will not go. I know legal
          ropes, I'l mako them fight every step,
          and I'm not afraid nt that."
          A message from Chief Bull, of Buffalo
          asserts that Czolgosz was In Chicago
          August 18 in company with Emmu
          Goldman and Abraham Isaaks. Is
          aacks ond Miss Goldman claim that

          no legal evidence against them. Emma :
          Goldman was , not . a party to the pro

          police. I was informed this morning
          that Chief Beall had no evidence against
          them and I -..ve also been informed that
          there is no Intention of trying to extra
          dite them. We are therefore willing that
          the relators be freed;"
          Attorney Geeting, the relators, then
          demanded that in view of the gravity of
          the offense, which.had been charged
          asainst his clients that the prosecution
          be required to state.what cause, or what
          suspicions, weighed with the police -in
          making the arrest.
          Judge Chetlain said that in view of the
          fact that the prosecution representing
          both the city and the state, a* well as
          Buffalo by indirection, had agree- to the
          liberation of the prisoners* and admitted
          that there was no evidence against them;
          that there was no reason for further in
          quiry into the matter.
          "When arrested the charge against the
          relators was merely a misdemeanor and
          they were entitled to bail," the court
          said. "The case was one of such moment,
          however, and the whole nation was de
          manding of its officers their best efforts,
          that I felt justified in exercising all dis
          cretion. The prisoners, were therefore
          remanded without bail for further hear
          ing, pending an investigation by the
          police. The president died from the as
          sassin's bullet and the prisoners this
          time were remanded without bail at their
          own request to allow the fullest investi
          gation. Our duty has been fully done
          and now we have but to order and do so
          order, that the prisoners be liberated "
          The prisoners had been silent, their
          faces expressionless during the proceed
          ings. When the court ordered the jail
          doors opened to them there was not a
          trace of rejoicing on their faces.*
          The prisoners were led back to jail
          where they collected their belongings
          and then came down stairs, where they
          met friends and men of their faith. For
          the first time they showed evidences of
          pleasure. Capt. Rever, of the police de
          partment, offered them protection on the
          way to their homes., but Abraham
          .Frank, the editor, of an anarchist paper
          and looked upon as j the leader of local
          anarchists," refused It.. The party then
          aeparted in various directions.
          Emma Goldman,received the news of
          the liberation of her friends with a laugh.
          "I guess they'll have to let me go
          now," she said. "It has been shown
          that the men namcjl as conspirators with
          me did not conspire; and I fancy they
          would have trouble trying to show that I
          conspired all by myself." ' ' "*
          Assistant City Prosecutor Owen was
          asked by counsel for Miss Goldman to
          bring Miss Goldman's case before Justice
          Prindiville this afternoon that the de
          fendant might be free tonight. He said
          he would consider the matter.</text>

          an attempt was made to arrange
          some agreement among the nations of the

          as a political measure and are opposed

        <text>So far as he can be learned Czolgoz has
          'refused to mention any name except that
          of Emma Goldman, but papers are in
          existence which, if they can be discov
          ered, will lay bare the entire conspiracy
          -and will result in wholesale arrests, fol
          lowed by prosecutions.
          In his confession Czolgosz has told of
          his attempt to destroy the written evi
          dence of the conspiracy. He said that
          time did not permit him to burn the
          papers, as he had desired. Czolgoesz says
          that if he was to meet the president at
          the Temple of Muses at the pan-Ameri
          can exposition he had to be there early.
          Before leaving his room in Novak's ho
          EMMA GOLDMAN, FEMALE ANARCHIST,
          ARRESTED AT HOME OF A CHICAGO FRIEND
          CHICAGo, Sept. 11.-Emma Goldman,
          who was arrested by the Chicago police
          yesterday told the chief that she was
          having a little fun at the expense of the
          police department." She had intended
          today to give herself up to the police.
          "If these officers had come twenty min
          utes later I would not have been there,"
          she said. I would have been on my way
          to deliver myself to the police."
          An emphatic denial met the sugges
          tion that the assassin was spurred to his
          deed by her utterances.
          "I dont believe it," she cried, earnest
          ly. "I don't believe he ever said it. I
          have read the accounts, but I don't be
          Slieve they are true. I never urged vio
          lence. My lectures have never been
          published in a pamphlet or in a book.
          They have been printed in periodicals,
          but they never have been printed in per
          riodicals, but they never have advocated
          murder. I do not favor such means to
          our end."
          Miss Goldman wears heavy gold-rim
          med eye glasses, with powerful lenses.
          A prominent lower jaw, protruding
          slightly, gives evidence of determination
          which might escape notice at a casual
          glance. Her light hair, almost red, was
          brushed back from a broad forehead.</text>

          Hence the term "Ilnrmntlii :...."
          applied to practical science and philoso
          phy. The word astrology means liter
          ally the doctrine or seinnen ttf l,n
          but is especially taken to signify the art

          the time of his birth.
          In ancient times astrologers had mmv
          perils, as the following instance will
          liow: "Dost thou know where thou
          wilt pass Christmas?" asked Henry
          VIL (1488) of an astrologer. He could
          not tell. Wlieri'UDon the kinn-'a irrnen
          which did love a merry icst." made
          answer, " Then I am wiser than thou,
          for I know that thou will spend Christ
          mas in prison." Gailcazzo, Duke of
          Milan, was even merrier at the expense
          of an astrologer who foretold him that
          llP WOlllll dlP fwrlv " 1ml lir.,.r .1..

          astrologer. " My lord, my star promises
          me a long life." " Never trust in your
          star, man; you are to be hanged this
          moment." And the duke took good
          care that his own prediction should be
          fulfilled. Heggiage, nn Arab general,
          was more eourteous in the expression of
          111s aispieasure. ine general was sick

          mediately decapitated.
          Indeed, the wonder is that astrologers
          should so often have been fools. Few

        <text>POINTS ON ASTROLOGY.
          A SO CALLED SCIENCE THAT IS
          OLDER THAN HISTORY.
          Some of the Things Taught by IU Apostles.
          The Four General Departments How
          Wore the Planet at Your Birth? Do No
          Special Harm Noted Astrologers.
          Astronomy is ono of tbo oldest of sciences.
          It is certain that tho ancient Egyptians, Chal
          deans and Assyrians ware readers of the sky,
          and tho Chinese havo records of eclipses dat
          ing back thousands of years before our era.
          Astrology has been called astronomy's sis
          ter, and it is also older than history; but
          there is a marked difference Astronomy ii
          true and astrology is falso, although tbo de
          ductions of tho latter are drawn from the
          same source as the former.
          Astrology was founded on tho vanity of
          mankind. Astronomy teaches us that this
          earth is .but a speck in tho universe, and
          that we play a very insignificant part in the
          scheme of creation; but the astrologers took
          the exactly opposite ground. According to
          their belief, tbo earth was tho center of the
          universe, and tho univorso only existed as
          an adjunct to man. Hence it followed that
          the planets exerted on influence overman
          kind. This crude belief was gradually enlarged
          nntil it became an art, and tho astrologer a
          very important personage. Kings and rich
          people kept their own astrologers, and other
          people consulted astrologers at bo much a
          visit, as credulous persons do fortune tellers
          at tho present day.
          No doubt there were a great many fraudu
          lent astrologers fellows who saw in tho art
          an easy way to make a living, but wo cannot
          doubt that tho majority of astrologers v, ere
          firm believers in tho so called science
          Among the most noted of tlieo were Clan
          dius Ptolemy, who compiled "Tho Tetrnbi-
          bios," being four books upon tho influence of
          the stars; Placidus, a Sptiui-h monk, nnd
          T tit, nt. T?.rllclw.in.i nf tlin tlinn nP fllmi'loc I
          II.
          Tiberius, emperor of Rome, practiced as
          trology, and Hippocrates, tho "Father of
          Medicine," ranked it among tho most im
          portant brnnches of knowledge for a physi
          cian. During the Middle Ages astrology was
          at its height of popularity. Even the great
          Lord Bacon believed in it firmly.
          It was a complete and complicated system,
          and contained rules which were so abstruse
          that they required years for thoir entlro mas
          tery. Nor did the adepts al ways agree in the
          mysterler of their art, but they were tairly
          in accord with the cardinal principles .
          There are four general departments in
          Mixology nativities, or tho, art of foretell
          ing from a study of the map of the. heavens
          at the moment of birth tbo general character
          and destiny of 'the questioner; mundane mat
          ters; or foretelling by the map of the heavens
          at certain stated times the'f ate of nation and :
          raceV sucb " wars, pestilences, floods and
          conflagrations? weather prophesying, or pre
          dicting from the mutual aspects vt the son,
          moon and planets what the weather will be
          at certain times and plaeca. Horary astrology
          is the art of predicting from a map of the
          heavens- at the tlmei of anxiety or, question
          the result of any-business or other matter of
          interest to the questioner.
          It is a fundamental doctrine in astrology
          that tho sun, moon and planets each exercias
          a distinct, peculiar and immediate influence
          upon man. This influence culminates at
          birth, and the ruling planet (which is called
          "the lord of the nativity") at that time exer
          cises such power over the child as to stamp
          its character upon the entiro life.
          This a.stt al influence extends not oidy to the
          whole life in general, but likewise to all its
          particulars of feeliugs, thought and actions
          in minutiae. This astral Influence determines
          man's physical appearance, intellectual pecu
          luiritiei, moral cnaracter, length of years,
          rank, fortune unci friends in bhort, deter
          mines his life.
          To "cast a nativity," it was necessary for
          the aUi olo;er to know tho exact instaut of
          birth. Then he diew a horoscope that is,
          made a map of the hoaveus at that instant,
          us ncciuutelj us hw knowledge of astronomy
          would permit, Jixl studied tho atpect of the
          plnnets.
          The zodiac is divided into twelve signs of
          SO degs. each, and from the conjunction of
          the planet; in theo signs and from tho vari
          ous positloiib of other planets they augured
          good or ill for the babe.
          Much, of course, depended Uon tho skill
          of the ubti olo-or, and a great deal upon his
          knowledge of human nature.
          It is safe to wiy that rich jeople generally
          got good aspects. But there are certain rules
          which all astrologers havo always claimed
          to be infallible.
          The moon rules the first four years of life,
          and during this period all other indications
          must bo intcrjweted with the fa'r "goddess
          of tho night" as tho dominator of tho activi
          ties and results.
          Her subjects that is, thoso born when th
          moon is in the ascendant ore pale and, se
          rene; and, whilo full in form and gentle in
          disposition, they ore apt tobolazyjoratloost
          rather inefficient.. They are frequently no
          ticeable for their large, languid eyeo and re
          ceding chin.
          The moou has much" todo with one's" nJit;
          ural pr6ponsiticsf aud so her position intha
          zodiac and her aspects with' the other powers
          should be, fully and accurately determined
          and carefully studied.'
          Good aspect 'wittf Saturn promlf lflgicleB;'
          gains ondli&uors tbrousVtho favor jf death
          or oiu people; nan asacts wiur eawnr, on
          th( contrary, presage injuries or loss from
          the same kind of poorde.
          Tho tfloon'in. favorable aspect with Jupiter
          promises ' wealth'; with ' Marsy success in all
          contests, competitions, constructions or man
          nal operations which'-require courage, skill
          and respoiihibllity; with Venus' many and
          devoted friends among the opposite sex; witk
          .Mercury, great good iortune through one's
          own superior montal attainmonts'and talent.
          Evil aspect with Mars presages boldness,
          rashness and discomfit from defeat by strong
          er opposing forces; and with Mercury, it an
          nounces dishonesty and untruthfulness; "
          Strange to say, the sun, which is th'e;rnoet
          glorious of all 'the heavenly bodies, is less no
          ticed in the horoscope than tho raooh,
          , The astrologer glvea as a'reason for this
          apparent negloct that tho, suq, although the
          source of all life and power, disponse&ihis in
          flaenco, through his lieutenants tho planets.
          It is also noticeable that Uranus and Nor-
          tune Havo no p'.-.co fit anclcril asti olbgy, arid
          very littlo in tho modern art. The reason is
          that theso two plauots were unknown until
          modern times. It is dreadful to think how
          much malign influenco theso two planets may
          havo exerted in past ages, and no ono a whit
          wiser.
          There nro astrologers at tho present day,
          and some of them publish annual almanacs
          which givo predictions a year in advance.
          Theso predictions, as a rulo, are couchod in
          vague languago, such as "January a great
          man will dio in America," a prediction which
          could hardly fail to come truo. Yet these
          impostors make a good living out of this do
          luiion. and as they cannot bo said to do any
          special harm thoy aro not interfered with.
          But It canuot b'o too often asserted that
          there is no truth in tho art and never was.
          Ths sun and all the planets may bo in con
          junction and exert no more influence for good
          orevil over a baby than a passing milk wagon
          in the street. Golden Days.</text>

          Her horoscope was as follows

          Explaining the Art
          In casting a horoscope the astrologer
          first places the signs of the zodiac in
          their proper locations for the date and
          hour of birth and then sets the planets
          In their respective places in the houses

          Mrs. Ogden Goelet consulted an astrologer
          onco upon a time, more for tho fun of it, per
          haps, than anything else: her horoscopo was
          as follows:
          To explain matters a littlo to the uniniti
          ated, astrologers divide tho sky into twelve
          equal parts, called the Houses of Heaven;
          each division has its special lnlluenco, as in

          In ensting a lioroscopo tho astrologer first
          places tho signs of the zodiac in their proper
          locations for tho date and hour of birth nnd
          then sets the planets in their respective places
          in tho houses.
          To return now to that interesting docu
          ment, Mrs. Goelet's horoscope. Her birth
          day was November 8, 1S5S. Tho sign Sagit

          both Mercury and Jupiter were iu tho ascend
          ant, while Venus had just rien nbovo tho
          Eastern horizon. Tho moon was in tho third
          houte and in Pisces. TTramis in tho fifth
          house in Tauru3; Saturn in tho sixth, also in
          Taurus: Mars in the ninth in'Leo and tho sun
          iu tho eleventh in Scorpio. Tho ascending"
          .sign gives the lady the tail statuo aud light
          complexion, which is her style, as wen as the
          courtesy for which sho is noted. She is
          rntljcr quick tempered so the stars declare.
          Venus, so near tho cusp of the ascendant, be-
          stowed a great tasto for music. Tho moon,
          Intho third house, indicated a fondness for
          short tours. Saturn in tho sixth house is un
          favorable; it wnrns of sickness to corno. Tho
          sun in the eleventh indicates tho possession
          of good and Arm friends.

          too has had his fortune read in the heavens.

        <text>ASTROLOGY NOW THE FAD,
          Sooiety Is Taking to Readlang Stars Instead
          of Palms.
          From the Chicago Chronicle.
          Society is getting interested in the
          stars, not astronomically, but astrologi
          cally, and astrology threatens to dis
          place palmistry as a social diversion.
          Some people say that society is fickle
          any way in its choice of entertainments,
          and what is a favorite one day will be
          tossed aside for something new to-mor
          row. The studies which verge on the
          occult and mysterious always interest
          the society folk, and any alleged science
          which professes to give them a glimpse
          at the future will have its day sooner
          or later. It will be on the top wave of
          popularity one day and go down the
          next only to bob up again at some fu
          ture time, when it has remained half
          way forgotten for a period.
          Now it is future prognostication via
          the stars that is arousing enthusiasm,
          and the astrologers are getting busier
          every day, and the star reader who has
          the greatest facility in telling about fu
          tures is the busiest of them all. Astrol
          ogy has been slightly dormant for some
          time, but now is experiencing a greater
          revival than it has known for years.
          Many people in Chicago are taking hold
          of it with such vigor that they are delv
          ing into old, musty books, as well as a
          rew mooern volumes, nning out atn
          ab6ut destiny ad told by the stars. The
          astrologer who comes around to see any
          of these people would better be well up
          in his art. The popular way of provid
          ing astrological entertainment is to have
          an astrologer come in a professional
          way to a private home, where a party
          of congenial friends has assembled to
          hear the reading of the characters and
          futures of all those present. All of the
          guests have been previously instructed
          by the hostess to find out as nearly as
          possible the exact hour at which they
          were born. All those invited to the star
          party then begin a short season of activ
          Ity in diving into their early histories.
          Sometimes these lower branches of the
          genealogical tree are hard to find, but
          everybody knows at least the day of his
          birth and the astrologer can tell a great
          deal with only that much Information
          Fortified with all the information ob
          tainable regarding the time of their
          birth, the guests assemble at the home
          of the hostess and the astrologer makes
          his appearance. He is often gazed upon
          with no little awe by the company, be
          cause all of them are fully aware that
          he is going to tell them a lot of won
          derful things they would rather not
          have revealed. When the latter feature
          Is in prospect it often superinduces a
          little nervousness. With some kinds of
          peoplle this may even add to the fascina
          tlon of the art. Generally the astrolo
          ger takes the guests in regular order as
          they are, seated about tile parlor, and,
          taking the hour of the birth of each
          subject, caste a brief horoscope and
          reads to the entire party the character
          and future of the person before him.
          The astrologer does not conlfine himself
          entirely to the character and future of
          his subject, but often rummages around
          considerably in his or her past. While
          each person is up for consideration the
          whole party sits silently about the par
          lor listening Intently to the horoscope
          as revealed by the astrologer. Often
          times the revelations aftord the guests
          much amusement and the subject con
          siderable confusion. However, the
          hostess is careful to select guests who
          are either very well acquainted with
          each other or who she is sure will be
          congenial. Then there is not likely to
          be any embarrassment of much mu
          ment.
          'cuople of all ages take an interest in
          these astrology parties, but perhaps the
          young and middle-aged take a warmer
          personal interest in them than the old
          folks. Sometimes the latter take great
          interest In them on account of their de
          scendants. Then the astrological afTairs
          partake of the nature of family parties.
          Fathers and mothers have the astrologer
          cast the horoscopes and read the ch.tr
          aeters of the;r children and grandpa
          rt nts have hinl do the same for grand
          children. Sonme of these parents and
          grandparents believe so firmly in the
          readings of the astrologer that they aLt
          gulded, or at least considerabl intlu.

          child had well detined talent in a ,certain

          them, mostly 25 dents a bottle.
          J. P. Gardner, Claemont. Dodge Coun
          ty, Minn., says: "For two years I suf
          fered very greatly with rheumatism. At
          times the pain, soreness, and lameness
          were so bad I could scarcely get about to
          my business I tried many kinds of medi
          cine without benefit, until I bought a
          bottle of MwPyon's Rheumatism Cure
          and began tatting the pellets. A few bot
          ties have cured me entirely."
          Mr. 8. D. Hock, 1180 Grand Avenue,
          Racine, Wis., says: "My -wife suffered
          from severe pains in her shoulders and
          arms since she was seventeen years of
          age. At night times, the pains were so
          svere she hhad to get up and walk the
          door. It seemed impossible to get relief.
          I finally induced her to try Munyon's
          Rheumatism and Neuralgia Cures. After
          she used one bottle the pain left her, and
          has not returned, although that was over
          fourteen months ago."
          If in doubt, write Professor Munyon, at
          Philadelphia, Pa,. and get medical advice
          free.
          her and her heart. Perhaps the next time
          his advice will be of a negative nature,
          and he will say to a young man, "Do not
          marry a woman who is of a spirituelle,
          religious nature and inclined to be jeal
          ous, for you wouldn't get along with her
          very well. You are rather materialistic
          and also inclined to be a little flirtatious."
          Then the astrologer gives the party a
          little dissertation on the subject about
          like the following: "The personal mag
          netism or aura of two people relates them
          harmoniously or the reverse. This force,
          or rather these forces, in two people de
          termine whether or not they can live
          together in peace and happiness. If these
          magnetic currents cross and conflict then
          the man and woman will never get along
          well along together, but If they do not
          cross then the happiness of the two is
          assured. For instance, two people who
          are of a combative, irritable, unyielding
          disposition should never marry. Only
          trouble can possibly result from such a
          union. While some characteristics must
          not be possessed in common by those who
          would live happily as husband and wife,
          others must be common to them both.
          For instance, a woman who Is of a deeply
          religious nature could not be happy with
          a man who was not at all religious, nor
          could a woman who is sympathetic and
          finely organised find enjoyment with a
          man who is coarse, cold and unsympa
          thetic. Then again, while an unselfish per
          son, for instance. might nqt admire a sel
          fish person, still two such people might
          get along much better together than two
          selfish people." While the hearers are
          very fond of details that affect them in
          a very personal way, they are., neverthe
          less, pleased with these generalities,
          which are made so clear that they can
          apply the principles themselves.
          The astrologers can he divided into two
          classes by what they assert the stars re
          veal. One class claims to he able to read
          personal acts and small details from horo
          scopes, while the other class says that
          such things are impossible and that the
          stars will only reveal general truths. Nat
          urally those of the latter class would not
          be found so interesting by those who are
          anxious to tear away the veil from the
          future. At the society gatherings the
          guests are more impatient to hear de
          tails than glittering generalities. If a
          dark man with a bundle Is going to ap
          pear in their life on the third day of next
          November they want to know it much
          worse than want to know that their af
          fairs will go well during the coming
          year. If a black-eyed girl with a stiletto
          concealed in her bosom is even now on
          their trail they would much prefer to
          be acquainted with the fact than to be
          told that they would probably be 1ll some
          time within the next 1:1 months. So the
          astrologer who professes to tell details
          and personal acts is more sought after
          for the social gatherings than the man
          who says that only generalities can be
          told.</text>

          What It Is, and What It Will Do
          An Explanation of This Ancient Science as Practiced by Alice Currier, a
          Recent Arrival in Aberdeen, Who Has Opened a Studio of Astro
          logy in the Waldron at 412 West Heron St.
          Astrology is the science which
          teaches of the effects of the planets
          on human life and the things of the
          earth. By it are indicated future
          possibilities, according to the posi
          tions of the heavenly bodies at the
          time of birth. That it is the oldest
          science in existence is proved by the
          fact that the astrological signs have
          been found in ancient temples known
          to be more than ten thousand years
          old, and it is even older than the
          ruins of Egypt and India.
          Astrology today is based on sound
          mathematical calculations, the result
          of thousands of years of occult study
          and investigation. Every person
          born on this earth is ruled by som.e
          planet and sign of the zodiac. As
          these planets and signs are ever
          changing in their aspects, no two-per
          sons can be born exactly alike. Even
          twins born a few minutes apart will
          differ in character, disposition and
          temperment. It is this influence
          that causes the great diversity of hu
          man life.
          Astrology must not be confounded
          with fortune telling, magic, clair
          voyance. spiritualism or mystery of
          any kind. It does not teach a fixed
          ridding the public service of corrup
          tion. You can render no better ser
          vice to the state than in providing
          for a continued and effective crusade
          against dishonesty and venality in of
          fice.
          In conclusion, I trust your deliber
          ations will be characterized by a
          spirit of fairness and be confined to
          the matters growing out of a consid
          eration of the report of your commit
          tee. M. E. HAY.</text>

        <text>Tho Distinguished Astrologer.
          THIS is tho predestined year in which
          the Star of Bethlehem reappears 1n
          the heavens to herald the battle of
          Armageddon. Already in the evening skle3
          the star, which is really a comet, is dimly
          discernible, and as tho titanic conflict now
          raging reaches its climax it will bo visible
          to all fives.
          This celestial body has Recently been
          named by astronomers ?* "D'elevan's
          Comet," but it has always been known to
          astrologers as "the Star of Bethlehem."
          It may be seen in North America about
          10 o'clock on clear nights at a point al
          most directly below tho Pole Star. As
          tho night wane3 it rises higher in the
          heavens, nnd "in tho oarly morning be
          tween 2 and 4 o'clock it reaches its great
          est altitude aboyo tho horizon.
          A great mass of interesting evidenco has
          been collected to show that the present
          comet is really the Star of Bethlehem.
          These facts should interest both sceptical
          scientists and those who devoutly believe
          in astrology. A noted astrologer, who is
          also a competent scientific astronomer, has
          shown that the present comet will in De
          .cember 25 occupy almost tho same posi
          tion in the heavens that was occupied by
          the star whose'appearance is described in
          the Gospels. He has calculated closely the
          position of the star at that time from the
          accounts in the Bible and from other rec
          ords. Of course there has been a certain
          change of position in tho two thousand
          years that have passed due to the fact
          that all the heavenly bodies are moving.
          It may l>e recalled that some people be
          lieved that Halley's comet which reap
          peared in lf?lo was the Star of Bethlehem,
          but astronomers have shown that this
          comet could not have appeared in the first
          year of the Christian era, whereas the
          present comet may have been seen at that
          time and judging from its present appear
          ance occupied the quarter of the. Heavens,
          i'.' e.. "in the East," which is clearly indi
          cated by the Bible.
          The Star was first observed by man
          kind during the cruelties committed by
          King Herod in Palestine. It then guided
          tho three wise men from the East to the
          manger where the Saviour was born.
          Whenever it has appeared since thpn it
          has betokened an event of the utmost irn
          portance to humanity. It was seen in
          10G6, the year of the Norman Conquest
          of England, as the ancient Bayeux tap
          estry, woven at that time, clearly proves.
          Again it was seen in the year l-IJOO wheu
          the Crusaders took Jerusalem and- the
          Holy Sepulchro'^rom the infidels.
          To the eyes, of those who saw it in 1300
          it appeared to take the form of a flaming
          sword, a fact attested by ancient chroni
          cles and a sculpture in Rhelms Cathedral.
          The pious beholders were confirmed in
          their belief that this was the Star of Betli
          iehein because they believed it was a ful
          fillment of the Saviour's prophecy "I 'came
          not to snnd peace, but a sword." (St. Mat
          thew X. 24.)
          My learned friend, Professor Sepharial,
          of London, has recently explained in his
          work "Cosmic Symbolism" why the comet
          now dimly visible in our evening skies
          must be the Star of Bethlehem.
          "Tycho Brahe observed the star in 1672,"
          Bays Professor Sepharial, "and Sir John
          Horschel predicted that it would reappear
          in the present century. Tycho tells us that
          the star gradually grew in luminosity until
          it outshone Sirius, and even Venus, and
          gradually disappeared.
          "The star appeared above the head of
          Andromeda in the constellation Cassiopeia.
          This would give it about thirty-two degrees
          of north declination, and thus make its ap
          pearance vertical to the latitude of Bethle
          hem in Judea. The sign of the Zodiac co
          inciding with its longitude would be Aries,
          which, according to Ptoiemy, rules over
          Judea.
          "This observation signifies the require
          ments of that passage where the Magi are
          reported to have said: 'We have seen his
          Star in the east, and have come to worship
          him.' Then, if a geographical quarter was
          referred to by 'the east,' why should they
          travel westward from Persia to Judea?
          Obviously they referred to the quarter of
          the heavens, and being astrologers, would
          well know that Judea was signified by
          Aries, in which sign the Star made its ap
          pearance. Its standing over the house
          where the child lay indicates its position
          in the zenith of Bethlehem at the time of
          its southing, the latitude of Bethlehem
          being 31 degrees -13 minutes north in
          agreement with the observed position of
          the Star in Tycho's time."
          We know what events1 happened in the
          year when the Star of Bethlehem first ap
          peared, and we know what has happened
          on every appearance of the Star since
          then. Can we doubt that the mighty events
          i'.
          of this year are connected with its return?
          Will any reasonable man question that
          this world-war is the battle of Armaged
          don foretold in the Bible? In the six
          teenth chapter of the Book of Revelation,
          St. John writes:
          "And tho sixth angel poured out his
          vial upon the great river Euphrates, and
          the water- thereof was dried up, that the
          way of the kings of tho East might be
          prepare^. And I saw three unclean
          spirits like frogs come out of the mouth
          of the beast, and out of the mouth of the
          false prophet.

          war we shall have a thousand years of
          peace, after which, will come the general
          resurrection, and the end of Lhc world.

          "It is an ominous year for tho Kaiser of
          Germany, and no glory will accrue to him
          from its momentous events.
          "Tho Austrian Empiro is tottering to its
          ruin."
          A correspondent of the London Times
          has .described a conversation in which a
          gypsy woman foretold to tho old Emperor
          William, grandfather of tho present Kaiser,
          the evenCs' of this year. The Emperor, who
          was then Prince William of Prussia,
          met the woman npar Mainz in 1849. She
          addressed him as "Imperial Majesty." Not
          a little amused, for at that' moment his
          chance of succeeding even tdHho throne of
          Prussia seemed Blight, the Prince asked:
          "Imperial Majesty, and of what empire,
          pray?" "Of the now German Empire," said
          the "woman. "And when Is this empire to
          be formed?" he asked. v
          The woman took a scrap and wrote oji
          It the year 1849. Then adding its figures
          together she obtained the total "22" which
          added to "1849" made "1871," the year in
          which King William was actually pro
          claimed German Emperor.
          "And how long am I to rule over this
          empire?" then ashed Prince William. By
          similar calculations she showed that ha
          would bo Emperor until 1888, and that the
          Empire itself would come to an end in
          1914.
          Tho Rev. Charles T. Russell, pastor of
          the Millennial Dawners, who worship in the
          Brooklyn Tabernacle, wafrned the people
          very" clearly that this would bo the year
          of the battle of Armageddon.
          "In view of this strong Bible evidence,"
          wrote tho Rev. Dr. Russell as long ago as
          1889, "wo consider it an established truth
          that the final end of the kingdoms of this
          * ? /'
          world, and the full establishment of the
          Kingdom of God will be established by tho
          end of A. D. 1914."
          The Rev. Dr. Russell very rationally ar
          gued that the battlo of Armageddon signi
          fied that the common people would turn
          upon their* kings and rulers who had
          wickedly led them into war. He believes
          that before tho closo of the present war
          tho nations will dethrone all kings and
          form a universal brotherhood which will
          make a conflict like- this impossible In
          future.
          M. Peladan, the distinguished leader of
          tho myotic Rosicrucian fraternity, has
          pointed out in tho Paris Figaro that the
          details of this conflict were foretold with
          amazing exactitude by Brother Johannes,
          a monk, In the year 1600. The prophecy
          of Brother Johannes, written in Latin, be
          gins thus:
          "People will Imagine that they havo seen
          him many times, for all tho slayers of tho
          Lamb rosemblo one another, and all the
          wicked are precursors of the great wicked
          one.
          "The veritable Antl-Ghrlst will bo ono of
          (lie monarchs of his time, a son of Luther;
          ho will call upon God and proclaim him
          self as His envoy.
          "Ho will havo only ono arm, but his In
          numerable armies, taking as a motto 'God
          with us,' will seem like infernal legions.
          "For a long time he will act by ruse and
          treachery, and his sr/ies will overrun tho
          wholo earth, and he will be master of the
          secrets of the mighty. * * *
          "A war will give him the occasion to
          remove his mask. It will not begin against
          a French monarch, but against another,
          and in two weck3 it will be universal. ? ? *
          "His words will be like those of the
          Christians, but his acts will bo those of
          ^ Nero and the Roman persecutors; lie will
          have an eagle in his escutcheon and there
          will be ono also in that of Ills acolyte, tho
          other bad monarch.
          "But the other is Christian, and he will
          die under tho malediction of Pope Bene
          dictus, who will be elected at tho begin-'
          ning of the reign of Anti-Christ" '
          , From tho French point of view tills
          prophecy points clearly to tho German
          Kaiser, who, as most people know, has
          only one good arm. Tho other monarch!
          referred to as having an eagle in his arms
          is tho Austrian Emperor. Tho reference
          to "Pope Benedict" is most impressive, for
          the present,Pope was elected and assumed^
          that namo after tho beginning of the war,!
          and wo have been told that he has pro
          tested vigorously to tho Austrian Emperor
          against certain shocking occurrences.</text>

        <text>At thirty minutes past midnight
          cd the morning of January IS I
          ! jiood In front of my tent at Tabriz
          ird gazed heavenward at the stars,
          for such is my custom, being born
          (o the knowledge of astrology and
          having studied the occult sciences
          from my youth to this my six and
          eightieth year. As I looked, be
          hold, there was a wonderful com-
          motion of the stars, as though a
          Btw chieftain was being born on
          the earth. As princes are born fre
          quently I paid little attention to
          this phenomenon, but suddenly the
          illence of the night was broken and
          j there was a sound of singing among
          the stars the like of which, I in all
          my years of star watching had
          tever heard before.
          'Then my eyes were opened more
          to I could see the commotion of the
          itsrs was not indicating the ordi
          nary birth of a prince. This one
          was to be a powerful leader. I
          ; quickly brought forth my instru-
          I raents to make examination to see
          If the child would be a religious
          prophet I saw instantly that he
          irould not Then I was hard put to
          km what kind of n leader he
          lould be. I examined the houses of
          kings and found that the child was
          not of royal parentage, but I saw
          4
          his gianuiutnti wujj a ruler of
          1 public.
          "It was not given me to see what
          :Publlc he was chief over, but I
          sickly measured the angles of the
          'tars in the heavens and computed
          he distances from the constellation
          t Aquarius and Capricorn and then
          1 found that the child was born at
          lnat minute under the seventy-seventh
          meridian, reckoning from
          Sreeowich westward. As Tabriz in,

          Publics and 1 am at a loss to know
          ho the child may be. but no doubt
          , hen this news is transmitted to the
          ?,vUizcd world they will learn that a

          Corn and also of Aquarius gave
          j Iromlse that the child would be an
          'rNt RUI when I looked further
          ' av he would be more than an
          inlt. He would he n reformer, ho
          1 ould be elevated to a lofty posi
          tion and be granted long life. But
          it took some time to see what lofty
          position he would be elevated until
          I had just taken note that the mys
          tic planet Neptune was just appear
          ing above the horizon on the seventy-seventh
          meridian. I look the
          aspect of Neptune and also of the
          other planets. I then examined the
          Pleiades and behold, I found the
          political ruler of the world at some
          future date had been born.
          PERSIAN DECIDES DABY
          WILL BE WORLD PRESIDENT.
          Now, having read all tho signs
          I nm ready to declare that the child
          born at that time will be the future
          president of the world. The sing
          ing of the stars ceased before I had
          finished my computations. Day was
          dawning before I was able to fig
          ure who the new born babe was to,
          be. I would w ish to see him, but I
          am too old."
          Tho reading of the stars of the
          Persian was more or less of a joke to
          the Europeans. They figure that
          the future ruler of the world will
          be on their side of the Atlantic, but
          the prediction of the Persian savant
          was published in the Pctrograd
          papers and translations reached
          America. The other day an Ameri
          can in reading the data, figured that
          when it was thirty minutes past
          midnight at Tabriz it was 4:30 p. rru
          January 17 at Washington. The
          baby could be no other than Fran

          Is what their "science" would lead us to ex
          pect, as the appearance of the great comet
          In Aries was said by ancient astrologers to
          presignlfy "evil and detriment to the Eastern
          part; sorrows to the peoples under Aries;
          the clash of arms and bloodshed; death or
          dethronement of some king." Since the
          comet appeared two local wars have oc
          curred In the Balkans, Italy has been at
          war with Turkey. King Edward VJI., the
          leading monarch of Europe, has died, and
          now the greatest war of all time U raging.
          The astrologer explains that Pons's
          Comet passed Its perihelion in December,
          1812, and immediately after that Moscow
          was burnt and Napoleon's grand army was
          nearly exterminated in its retreat from
          Russia. The comet of 15515 was marked by
          the abdication of Charles V. of Germany.
          The astrologers assert that they gain their
          fore-knowledge of coming events by study
          ing the heavens from many different points
          of view. The position of the sun with re
          gard to the planets and stars is the most
          important heavenly Influence on human ac
          tions and earthly occurrences. The position
          of the moon, owing to its nearness to us,
          and the Important gravitational inliuence it
          exerts upon our minds and bodies. Is next
          In Importance. The study of the horoscope
          of an Individual, starting with the hour at
          which he was born and the position of the
          various heavenly bodies at that moment, is
          another common method by which the as
          trologer peers Into the future. Then again,
          the study of the palm of an individual
          helps to round out the labors of the as
          trologer.
          By the use of all these methods, an as
          tonishing number of curious occurrences all.
          over t'ne world are foretold with remark
          able detail. For instance, wo are told that
          there will be a new gold strike In the State
          of Montuna which will bo a complete sur
          prise to mining engineers. A volcanic erup
          tion will occur in the northwestern part of
          the United States.
          A prehistoric monster left over from the.
          age of the dinosaurs, or giant lizards, will
          be found in the interior of Alaska. A
          similar discovery will be made in the un
          explored wastes of Northern Siberia, but
          here tl\c animal will not be of such great
          antiquity. It will be just a hairy mammoth,
          a kind of elephant with long hair and enor
          mous tusks, whose family is supposed to
          have disappeared from this part of the world
          only three thousand years ago.
          There will he trouble between the United
          Slates and Canada leading to the verge of
          war, owing to the refusal of the latter
          colony to deliver up a loading Mormon de
          manded by the former.
          A new race will be discovered in an un
          explored part 01 the Arctic regions, whose
          existence will clear tip the mystery of the
          origin of the American Indians.
          A prominent citizen of Texas, it is stated,
          will lose his life through a rattlesnake bite.
          There will be a plague of  caterpillars in
          Georgia. The numerous Japanese still per
          mitted to live in California will rise against
          their benefactors. There will be an earth
          quake ?n Kansas. A meteor will fall from
          the sky and damage the heart of Montreal.
          Great excitement will be caused by the
          discovery of a submarine base maintained
          by a warring Knropenn power upon the
          American coast. It will then be fully proved
          that eubmarlnes can cross the Atlantic, a
          fact asserted by engineers during the past
          year.
          A noted American traveler will be de
          voured by a tiger in India. An Mmperor
          will sit on the throne of China once more.
          It is significant how much attention the
          prophets and astrologers now pay to the
          future of the United States, although they
          are laboring in Europe. Kor instance, we
          are told that the stars portend the birth of
          a great poet in KanBas during the coming
          Summer.
          It will be a year of great misfortune and
          dlacomfort among the reigning families of
          Europe. Not only such prominent figures
          as the Kaiser of Gerintfhy and the King of
          England are in danger, but many minor
          sovereigns will meet disaster. The King of
          Greece, we are told, will be separated from
          his wife. The King of Sweden, who is of
          French descent, will finally divorce his
          wife, who Js n relation of the Kaiser. The
          Czarina of Russia will become hopelessly
          insane. King Ferdinand of Bulgaria will
          perish by a bomb. A German princess re
          lated to the Kniser will run away with the
          gardener at the family castle.
          It will be an epoch of revolution and in
          novation in the conservative Orient. The
          old Arabian empire, once ruled over by the
          celebrated Caliph Harun-Al-Rashid, will be
          restored at Bagdad, while the Turkish
          empire will be annihilated. Constantinople
          will become a free international city, where
          all the world may meet on erjual terms.
          A Chinese scientist will surprise the world
          by announcing that he has received mes
          sages from Mars by wireless telegraphy. An
          American girl of vast fortune and great
          beauty, tired of the artificial conventions
          of life in Europe and America, will marry
          u wild Afghan chieftain and settle down
          to live with him happily according to the
          native, customs.
          Several aeroplanes will cross the Atlantic
          Ocean in the Autumn Quarter. A beautiful
          and noted American grand opera singer will
          die by violence in Chicago in the most

          There is also a large class of astrologers
          and prophets in the United States who have
          been studying the heavens in order to warn
          mankind of the impending events of the

          wild advance of the Occident hne tended to
          depart from Nature and to substitute
          Artifice, and it must pay for its folly. The
          world has now entered the domain typified
          by the HUMAN side of the Great Sphinx,
          THE FACE. Twelve thousand years ago
          the Sphinx was built to commemorate the
          Recession of the Equinox from the Virgin
          into the Lion, hence the lion's body, and
          human face. The Lion is ruled by the Sun.

          will be, not how much money can we hoard

          What the Horoscopes of
          European Monarchs Reveal
          A SEARCHING study of (he horoscopes of nil tho monarchs of
          Europe and General Joffre and the other great leaders of the
          armies and navies, taken in connection with the peculiar posi
          tion of the moon and other planets, has led the hest known prophets
          all over the world to the conclusion that tho great war will end. next'
          Spring. Many ancient predictions have been recalled which, curiously
          enough, seem to have foretold the present world-wide conflagration,
          and to have also fixed the coming Spring as the end of the conflict.
          One seer fixes upon May 22 as the last day of lighting, and predicts
          that the terms of peace will.be signed on May 101'5; others fore
          see the end of the war in April.
          Printed elsewhere on this page is an astrological diagram of
          ihe position of the heavenly bodies at the Winter Solstice at Berlin.
          Commenting on the relative position of the planets during the Fall,
          Winter and Spring, it is pointed out that the nativity of King George
          of England "has a benefic primary direction of the inoon to Jupiter in
          force this Spring, favoring an early return of prosperity and peace for
          England."
          Venus and Jupiter enter Aries, England's ruling sign, on February
          13. and Jupiter remains in this sign until the middle of the year. A
          notable confirmation of the indications of peace is found by studying
          this diagram of tho Winter Solstice at Berlin, which rules the first
          three months of 1916. Professor Zadkiel divines from this that:
          "The last decanate of Virgo ascends and the Moon and Saturn are
          in the tenth mansion and Jupiter is setting. This seems to presignify
          that the terrible losses of the German and Austrian armies nnd the
          sufferings of the civilians will compel their rulers to sue for peace."
          Tho presence of Jupiter exactly on the western angle of tho figure
          (the angle of war) points surely to the probability of an appeal for
          peace on behalf of Germany, and not impossibly to an armistice, even
          if this does not lead to an immediate settlement. The presenco of the
          Moon conjoined with Saturn at the mid-heaven, coinciding with this. ?
          is an Lndicatiou of grave discontent on the part of the people and re
          verses to their rulers. It may even be a portent of the commencement
          of a revolutionary movement which will lead to the downfall of the
          present dynasty. #
          Mars Appears Unfavorable to the Kaiser
          The stationary position of Mars on New Year's Day close to the
          eclipse of August last year and afflicting the horoscopes of the Tsar,
          the German Emperor, as well as that of President Polncare, seems to
          indicate very sanguinary fighting about the end of December and be
          ginning of January. It is remarkable that this position falls within a
          quarter of a degree of the very commencement of the sign Virgo,
          which has been traditionally associated with tho Turkish Empire.
          A further augury for an early peace is to be found in the horoscope
          of the King of Belgium, whose forty-first solar revolution (birthday)
          on April 8, 1910, shows Venus, the planet of peace, close to the upper
          meridian, and the Sun nearly in conjunction with Jupiter and in trine
          with Mars. A good direction of the ascendant, to the major benefic is
          due very shortly after. The Tsar also has an especially favorable
          aspect for peace (Sun in conjunction with Venus), coming up with tho
          Summer months. I
          Many old prophecies hundreds of years old deal with the predic
          tion of the coming of "'Antichrist, the Beast of Revelations." as sot
          forth in the Bible in the Book of Revelations, and undertake to show a
          parallel between the German Emperor and Antichrist. A frequent pre
          diction has been that the old Roman Emperor Nero would again re
          appear on earth "as a messenger and forerunner of the Evil One,"
          coming for the devastation of the earth and the overturning of the
          human race.
          The old Latin writer, Lactantius. sets forth this prediction, and
          Professor Trefusls writes:
          "Nero loved ostentation and parade. I!e must fill the stage. Ho
          travelled about in a restless way. Of his amateur skill in acting, music
          and singing he was inordinately vain?an egomaniac, but nevertheless
          a man of many talents.
          "He ended his miserable existence by his own hand, l?S A. I) , on
          the success of the revolution of Galha, his Governor in Spain, leaving
          a name proverbial for all that is devilish.
          "IIo has now returned as Antichrist, the Beast of Revelation, and
          the world has awakened at last to his true character..
          "The order to sink the l.usitania is in strict accord with Nero's
          iecord?asphyxiating gases, flame projectors and corrosive liquid all
          show tho mind of Nero."
          A distinguished French monk nearly four hundred years ago wrote
          that "in 1915 the Turks, Heretics, Schismatics. Catholics and Idolaters
          of foreign nations will go against each other with anger and fury. The
          first spark of the great war will start from the North. The war will
          last about two years, until all the Powers of Europe will be allied
          against them." This prediction concludes with a description of the
          Thanksgiving services in all the Christian churches) and temples for
          ;he ultimate victory of the Allies.
          Another prediction made before the war ov ihe llev. Dr. Cummlng
          ts as follows: "Russia, driven away from her frozen trenches, will
          again return, crushing every resistance, and she will even reach Pales
          tine. England will defend to tho very end God. the Bible, freedom and
          life, until the Pope will crown with his own hands a personage and*
          declare him Emperor of the Romans, and there shall be then peace
          throughout the world."</text>

        <text>ANCIENT SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC
          artist, Milton Monroe, has reduced the sym
          bolism of the Zodiac to the beauty of colors.
          Persons born between May 21 and June
          20, according to Astrology, are under the
          sign of Gemini, the Twins, or the third sign
          of the Zodiac. They possess intellectuality,
          literary ability and versatility.
          Gemini is one of the Air signs in this
          series, expressed in the cloud motif at the
          feet of the Twins. People bom in the other
          Air signs will make the best life partners.
          Those born in the fire signs will make good
          friends, as "air and fire mix well."
          The symbols of Mercury and Jupiter are
          shown in the lower right-hand corner
          of the illustration above. If your birthday
          falls between May 21 and June 20, Mercury
          is your best planet, while Jupiter is detri
          mental, according to Astrology.

          ancient belief being that those born under
          the sign of Gemini should regard these
          limbs as their chief strength, while at the
          same time being reminded that these por
          tions of the body are the most suscepti
          ble to affliction.
          Ancient symbolism also holds that the
          man or woman born under this sign of the
          Zodiac must guard against changeability
          and superficiality, "as these are weak
          nesses of the Gemini person."</text>

          some regard as legend handed down from
          the ages of superstition and which others
          regard as symbols of scientific fact, have

          time that encompasses the anniversary
          of his or her birthday.
          It was the ancient belief that every per

        <text>The Wise Men of the East were
          doubtless versed in astrology and believed
          that any special aspects of stars and planets
          in the sky often foretold events in the affairs
          of mankind. Modem astronomy may have
          little use for astrology, but nevertheless the
          astronomers of today are indebted to the early
          astrologers for many observations of the stars
          and planets on which early progress in as
          tronomy depended.
          As the various planets rove about the sky,
          weaving their way in and out. among the stars,
          they frequently pass each other, sometimes
          in close proximity. The band around the sky
          which the roving planets appear to follow is
          familiarly known as the Zodiac. Various parts
          of the Zodiac have had special astrological
          significance.
          In one region of the Zodiac is a large con
          stellation, Pisces, the Fishes. In this constella
          tion. in the year B.C. 7, Jupiter and Saturn,
          two major planets, were in conjunction within
          one degree of each other. It has been thought
          by some that this conjunction of Jupiter and
          Saturn may have been the astronomical event
          that lay back of the story of the Star of
          Bethlehem.
          Johann Kepler, a distinguished German as
          tronomer who lived in the Seventeenth cen
          tury, made a careful study of the astronomical
          positions of the planets near the time of the
          birth of Christ. He found that not only were
          Jupiter and Saturn in conjunction with each
          other in B.C. 7, but that they were in con
          junction three times that year, and all of
          these times in the constellation of the Fishes,
          a sign of the Zodiac which has long been
          known to be of special significance to the
          Hebrews.
          The two planets, Jupiter and Saturn, in
          close proximity always make an interesting
          spectacle. It is not difficult to imagine that
          the astrologers of the Eastern country, seeing
          these two bright stars shining like a double
          star together above the eastern horizon four</text>

        <text>The Mid-Winter evening sky is
          always interesting to star gazers
          because of its many first and
          second magnitude stars. These
          brighter stars are prominent in
          the pattern of several constella
          tions. Orion, considered by many
          people as the most beautiful
          constellation in the sky, is high
          in the southern sky in early
          evening.
          There are groups of constella
          tion that can be identified, and
          from them other groups can be
          located and identified. After the
          constellations are identified, it is
          easy to determine the named in
          dividual stars they contain. All
          Of the first and second magnitude
          stars are named independently
          They also have names pertaining
          to their constellations. Thus il
          is possible to know the stars by
          constellations and as individuals
          For instance, polaris, the north
          star, is also Alpha Ursa Minor.
          It is the brightest star in the
          Little Dipper.
          The evening sxy is consxanuy
          changing as the fixed stars seem
          to move about four minutes west
          ward each day. Consequently the
          position of any fixed star 01
          constellation is about one hour
          earlier each fortnight and twc
          hours earlier per month. Any
          star in a given position the firsl
          day of any month will be two
          hours west on the first day of
          the following month.
          Circumpolar Group
          An easy way to learn the
          stars is to begin with the cir
          cumpolar group. The pole star,
          Polaris, keeps approximately the
          same position all of the time.
          Unlike all stars outside the Cir
          cumpolar group, it never rises
          nor sets. Neither do nay of the
          OXner stars t»r tills group. They
          all seem to revolve around the
          North Star, remaining above the
          horizon.
          The latitude we live in deter
          mines the size of the circumpolar
          area. If we live on the 30th par
          allel, this area extends 30° in
          every direction from Polaris. If
          we live on the 35th parallel, it is
          a circle 35° in radius and 70° in
          diameter. Polaris is approxi
          mately the number of degrees
          above the horizon that our lati
          tude is north of the equator.
          The constellations of the cir
          cumpolar group are all easily dis
          tinguished on a dark, clear even
          ing. They are the Big Dipper, o
          • ^ Great Bear, The Little Dipper
          Or Little Bear,'€?assoperia, Draco
          Cepheus, and Camelopardalis
          There are no first. magnitude
          stars in any of these*' constella
          tions. Second magnitude stai;
          are seen in only three of them
          Ursa Minor, or the Little Dippe
          has two, Polaris, and the bright
          est star in the bowl. The Bij
          Dipper has two in its handle an<
          one in its bowl. Cassiopea, th<
          flattened W has two. The othe
          stars in this area are from th<
          third down to the sixth magni
          tude.
          The Zodiac
          There are 12 constellations ir
          the zodiac, a belt around the
          earth. They follow the ecliptic
          which is the apparent path oJ
          the sun. Since the plane of the
          earthte orbit is inclined 23.5° tc
          the celestial equator, it makes
          the zodiac seem to move thai
          number of degrees north anc
          south of the celestial equator.
          During the winter months the
          constellations of the zodiac arc
          south of the celestial equator
          They are seen best, therefore, a:
          the observer faces the south anc
          follows the path that the sur
          seems to have followed that day
          Our evening observation;
          would include these constella
          tions, beginning in the southeas
          with Leo, the Lion, Cancer, the
          Crab, Genini, the Tunis, anc
          Taurus, the Bull. A little earlier
          one might see Virgo, the Virgin
          in the Southwest, or if a little
          late, Aries, the Ram in the
          Southeast.
          In the constellation Leo, which
          can be recognized by the Sickle,
          we see the first magnitude star,
          Regulus, at the end of the handle
          of the Sickle. Cancer has neither
          first or second magnitude stars.
          Genini, has the first magnitude
          star Pollux, and the second mag
          nitude star, Castor. Taurus has
          the first magnitude red star, Al
          debaran.
          Other Constellations
          While still facing south, we
          have abroad oval area south of
          the zodiac with several constella
          tions. High in the sky is the bril
          liant Orion with its two first
          magnitude stars Betelgeuse and
          Rigel. It has four second magni
          tude stars. East of Orion is Mon
          oceros, while to the southeast is
          Canis Major with the brilliant
          first magnitude Sirius, the brigh
          test fixed star in the heavens. It
          has three second magnitude stars.
          Other constellations without
          bright stars are Lepus, the Hare,
          Eridanus, Cetus, the Whale,
          Fire Anis May
          Be Bombarded
          From Planes
          Experiments being carried on
          in Mississippi may lead to drop
          ping of poison from airplanes to
          Hydra, the Water Serpent, Pyxis,
          Puppis, and Columbia.
          Turning again to face the
          north, we see the broad belt be
          tween the zodiac and the circum
          polar group. In the northwest is
          seen Andromeda and Triangu
          lum. Above these comes Perseus
          with the variable star Algol. Al
          most over head is Auriga with its
          first magnitude star Capella.
          Moving eastward is Lynx which
          is made up of third and fourth
          magnitude stars.
          There is no evening star al
          this time. Venus, which has beer
          prominent in the southwesterr
          sky for several months, is now
          passing between the earth and
          the sun. The plants in the even
          ing sky are too faint to be seen
          There are many excelleni
          books published for teaching the
          stars to beginners. One of the
          best is an inexpensive and well
          illustrated one called “Stars” by
          Zim and Baker.

          COACH THE UNIVERSITY OF
          CALIFORNIA FOOTBALL TEAM.
          WILLIAM K VANDERBILT JR. TROPHY. "WHICH WILL BE CONTESTED FOR
          IN OCTOBER OVER LONG. ISLAND ROADS FOR THE FIRST TIME BY THE
          REPRESENTATIVE MOTORISTS OF THIS CQUNTRY AND EUROPE
          William K. Vanderbilt Jr. has offered
          a valuable trophy for a long distance
          automobile race which is expected to
          develop into a sensational international
          contest.
          The first race will be run on October
          8 of this year over a course on Long
          Island. The race will be held over a
          course of not less than two hundred
          and fifty miles nor more than threa
          hundred miles. It will be open to the
          motorists of the world, but it is speci
          fied that not more than ten men from
          one country will be allowed to com
          pete.
          The race must be held in America
          during 1904 and 1905. Subsequent to
          1905 it may be held In the country in
          which the cup is held. It is expected
          that having the race in America the
          first two years will give marked impe
          tus to the sport of long distance racing.
          The race must always be run on the
          public highways and never on the
          track. France will probably send her

          As Hopper has just returned from
          the East, where he had a chance to
          observe the way the game is played
          there, with all its up to date accessor
          ies, he will be invaluable to the Cali
          fornia eleven. "While in New York he
          had an opportunity to study the game
          closely, so that he is in touch with the
          latest style of play.
          Hopper is one of the idols of Cali
          fornia football history. During his col
          lege career he played football every
          year. He did not make the varsity
          eleven until '99, when he was quarter
          back of the famous team that beat
          Stanford SO to 0. In 1900 Hopper coach
          ed the eleven of the University of Ne
          vada that defeated Stanford that year
          and in 1901 assisted Dr. Frank Simp
          son in coaching the California varsity
          eleven.
          James Hopper has accepted the in
          vitation of the executive committee of
          the Associated Students to act as head
          coach this year for the football eleven
          of the University of California. The
          final arrangements were made yester
          day when Hopper met Colonel George
          C. Edwards, Graduate Manager Ezra
          Decoto, Football Captain Ben K.
          Stroud and James K. Moffltt of the
          executive committee and discussed
          terms that were accepted by the ath
          letic diplomats.
          The consent of Hopper to coach the
          team was not obtained without a good
          deal of persuading. Hopper had his
          heart set on returning at once to the
          Philippines, there to gather material
          for magazine stories. Such flattering
          inducements were held out to him by
          the committee that he decided at last
          to forego the trip until after the big
          intercollegiate game in November. Just
          what kind cf an offer decided Hopper
          to yield Is withheld by the parties to
          the transaction, but it is understood
          to be quite substantial.
          Hopper was hit upon as the man for
          the place after Harry Hudson of last
          year's eleven had declined the offer of
          the committee. Hudson holds a posi
          tion with the Southern Pacific Com
          pany at Bakersfleld and was disin
          clined to give up the opportunities that
          go with such a place to figure in the
          short-lived glories of the footAall field.

          In the toss for position late this after

          and won air three choices. Captain
          Dillingham chose the west lane for the
          university eight and faur-oared races
          and the east lane for the freshman
          event.

          NEW LONDON. Conn., June 29.—
          The annual regatta of Harvard and
          Yale oarsmen will be rowed over the
          Thames River course to-morrow. Fair
          weather and smooth water are ex
          pected. During the early hours of to
          night practically no bets of importance
          were made. The prevailing odds were
          on Yale at 2 to 1. At one of the hotels
          a slate of results that seemed to have
          some supporters had it that the four
          oared race would surely go to Har
          vard; that there was every prospect
          of a fairly stiff fight' between freshman
          eights, with probabilities in favor of
          Harvard, and that the Yale varsity
          eight would win the big race. However
          good this forecast may prove to be, it
          was remarked that, the reports from
          up-river, were strikingly alike to the
          effect that the two big crews are prob
          ablyTthe best that ever represented the
          two universities.'

          UXCLE'S 3IEX SHCT OUT.
          PORTLAND, June 29. — When Port
          land scored in the seventh inning the
          baseball fans went wild with delight.
          Jot the wise ones saw with prophetic
          eyes the game won by the home team.
          Nor was their faith in vain. Ike
          Butler, with perfect support back of
          him, shut out the San Francisco men.
          The final score was 1 to 0.*
          It Tras one of the prettiest pitchers*
          battles of the season. Butler's delivery
          •was above criticism, while Phil Knell,
          for the men from the south, pitched
          a brilliant game. The bunching of
          hits by the Browns in the seventh won
          the game. In this inning Drennan sin
          gled and was sacrificed to second by
          Beck. He went to third on Raymond's
          out and scored when Irwin failed to
          *=coop Castro's infield hit. Ike Fran
          cis played short and Raymond third.

          TACOMA, June 29. — After having
          the game won to-day the Tigers al
          most lost in the last two Innings.
          While at bat in the seventh St. Vrain,
          who had pitched shut out ball, had
          to retire, being hit on his throwing
          arm by a pitched ball. Toman sin
          gled and Flood tripled off Thomas,
          who was then replaced by Keefe. The
          latter was not warmed up and on
          ¦Wheeler's single a second run came
          In. Although Chase doubled after this
          no further damage was done.
          In the last inning Egan went out at
          first and Newton, who batted for
          Gray, fanned. * Toman hit safely for
          a base and Flood scored him with a
          double. Flood tallied on Smith's sin
          gle. Wheeler was unable to get the
          ball out of the diamond and the An
          gels failed to tie the score. St. Vrain
          may be out of the game for some
          time. Shechan and Nor^yke did some
          splendid fielding. Gray was in good
          form, but his battery errors coupled
          with timely hits gave the Tigers their
          runs. Score:

          this afternoon from Oakland. With
          the score a tie In the sixth Inning and
          one man on base, Smith drove the ball ;
          almost to the rlghtfleld fence for a
          home run. It was the longest bit ever
          made In Seattle and Smith reached the
          plate elx feet ahead of the ball, which
          was fielded perfectly by Ganley and
          Schlafley.
          The Oakland men started as if they
          intended to make mincemeat of Charley
          Hall, but the farther the game went
          the stronger the youngster pitched.
          Opposed to him was Buchanan. With i
          three men on bases and none out In the
          eighth. Hall retired the side on Infield

          Bros.' Dalvay, backed from 10 to 1
          down to 3 to 2 and closing at 9 to 5,
          was beaten a length by Peter J. Som
          mers, who was backed from 4 to 1 to
          7 to 2 at post time. Dalvay ran a mar
          velous race and his time must have
          been at least a second faster than that
          made by the winner.

          won his third straight victory when he
          annexed the third race easily. He was

          was allowed to set the pace to the
          stretch turn. Burleigh then went on

          fastest run race of the week. Three

          SHEEPSHEAD BAY, June 29. — The
          Cricket; was much the best horse" in the
          first race to-day, defeating South
          Trimble by two lengths. The unavail
          ing: effort of Hurst Park to snoulder
          129 pounds and concede thirty-four
          pounds to the three-year-old colt,
          Spring, in the second race was the
          theme of conversation among observing
          turfmen. On the track, which was still
          damp and somewhat heavy. Hurst
          Park was beaten a little over a length
          by his younger opponent, Spring, which,
          in the opinion of many, must have been
          overlooked by the handicapper.
          BT R. Thomas' St. Bellane won the
          Pansy selling stakes, although Merry
          Lark, the second horse, was an 8 to 5
          favorite.
          Ort Wells carried the high impost of
          130 pounds easily to the front in the
          fourth race. He had little opposition,
          Mercury being the best of the three
          which" opposed him. Ort Wells 'again
          showed he is much improved over his
          form of five weeks ago.
          "More reversals," said one of the
          best-known bookmakers at the close of
          the fifth race, which was won by, Agile,
          with the 7 to 10 favorite. The Claimant,
          in fourth place.

          '• The first serious accident of the day was re
          ported at the grandstand a few hours after the
          race had started- Word came that George
          Arenu, Jr.. and Carl .Menzel. his machinist, were
          W. K. VANPERBILT. JH.

          both thrown out of their machine at the Hemp-
          Mead Turnpike, near Queens, when a tire
          ElippeJ off and the machine made a somersault.
          As soon as William K. Vanderbilt, jr.. beard the
          news be immediately left the stand, and, jump
          ing into his automobile, with a physician, drove
          to the scene of the accident. The car was bad
          ly damaged. To avoid unduly exciting the crowd
          the serious results of the mishap were not an
          liounced.
          Tracy, driving the .'!,% horsepower Royal, of
          <\ K. Duerr, after going the first round in less
          than twenty-five minutes, was also competed
          to withdraw from the race owing to his machine
          going wrong.
          Haw-ley, the driver of K. R. Thomas's car. had
          a narrow escape while making: a sharp turn near
          ltocky Jim Road, at Queens, on the first lap. His
          machine swerved off the roadway, ran up on the
          grasrplot along the road, and missed crushing
          into a bisr tree by about tea inches. Hawley.'s
          clever handling alone prevented an accident.
          Tc-ste, the driver of the '.*» horsepower Pan
          liard-Levasser, made an excellent showing and
          made the best time up to the fourth round. A
          mishap in the next lap caused him to lose time.
          He withdrew in the next round. His time for
          these five rounds were as follows: 24 KM. 26:37
          -'5:45. 25:40. 4r, : :r_'.
          Schmidt, driving the Packard 30-horsepower
          car Gray Wolf, was just finishing his ninth lap
          when the race was called off. lie. too, had delay
          after delay with his tires. Another French
          driver to show up prominently was Tarte, in a
          IX >- horsepower Panhard. Although he was prac
          tically out of the race, owing to a punctured tin*
          that' cost him more than an hour and a quarter's
          delay in the first lap. he pluckily continued. On

          Isidor Wormier, Jr.*, «'.ii- horsepower Mercedes,
          driven by Luttgen, was the seventeenth car to
          be eeut off. It was far behind from the first
          round, and lost considerable time in the fourth
          round by a punctured tire at Jericho.
          The Long Island ferry officials had all they
          could do in the afternoon to furnish transpor
          tation to the crowds returning from the race
          Automobiles of every description kept arriving
          at the ferry or as near as they could get to it
          and at 3:30 o'clock there was a" line of cars that
          extended up liorden-ave. to Jackson-ewe, and
          the number was being constantly added to An
          extra squad of police was detailed to the ferry
          to maintain order and guard against accidents
          There was no trouble of any kind, though
          George Heath has spent much of his time
          abroad, and In the international contest repre
          sented the Automobile Club, of France He
          with Test* and Clement, made up the trio of
          Panhard drivers. His machine Is a 00-horse
          power Panhard and Levasasr gasolene car It
          has four cylinders, is driven by a propeller shaft
          and the ratio of the engine *T»—(i to the highest
          gear is 750 to wM, It has a double system of
          ignition by magneto and battery. The machine
          has four forward speeds and one reverse
          Before making the run yesterday. Mr. Heath
          declared that it was almost like committing «ul
          clde to race over such a course. "The road Is so
          soft ana narrow in places that It is exceedingly
          dangerous." he said. -If there are not lives
          lost at some of those sharp turns I shall be
          agreeably surprised."

          KILLED ON THE COURSE.
          Arents ft Car Overturned — Machinist
          Dead and Owner Hurt.
          The first Intimation the large crowd at Queens
          had of the accident !n which Carl Menzel, s
          driver, was killed, was at about 8:11 a. in . when
          the ambulance of St. Mary's Hospital. Jamaica,
          dashed nround the sharp south turn at full spec !
          and was soon lost up the Hompstoad road.
          About thr.-e miles from that point, not far from
          Elmont. on one of the best sections of the course.
          the 00-horsepowiT Mercedes owned and run by
          George Arents, jr., opsi t. and threw him and his
          machinist. Carl Menzel, violently to the t--
          According to the m.ly witnesses. C W. Ben-
          Jamin, a patent draughtsman, of No. '2** l Broad
          way; his son, C Kay Her.Jamln; Otto Post, of N<\
          60 Morgan-aye., Brooklyn, gnd Henry Xct 1
          of No IM2 Eist Kighty-third-st., the ma< nine
          had Just put on full spec -I, when the left front
          tire exploded and caused the steering gear to r t
          out of order.
          With th« axle of the front wheels twisi
          a position parrtliel to the road th»» ponderous
          racer skidded along for ifty feet at a terrific
          pace, tearing up the hard oiled road Into a
          blinding dust. The car floundered around, "In
          scribing a letter ' S," au.l finally, on the south
          side of the road; turned completely over, on top
          of Mr. Arents and hia machinist. Mr. Arents
          had shut off hia power In taking the slight
          turn of the course where the accident, incurred,
          and the tire blew out a few seconds after he
          had started up ■gain.
          Mr. Benjamin, his son and Otto Post had
          cleared the fence on the approach of the Mer
          cedes, and were dumfounded for a while after
          the machine turned over. The three men. after
          recovering from their fright, promptly under
          took to drag the victims from under the heavy
          mass of machinery. The elder Benjamin suc
          ceeded In getting out Arents, who was uncon
          scious, and young Benjamin worked on the dis
          abled man for live minutes trying to produce
          artificial respiration. By pulling at the sleeve
          of Menzel's coat Mr. Benjamin finally dragged
          him out. Menzel was unconscious and bleed
          ing profusely from the nose and ears. The
          wrecked racer took up a third of the road.
          Suddenly the sharp cracking of Tarte'S 9<>
          horsepower Panhard was heard in the distance,
          and Benjamin, leaving the bleeding man, rushed
          out into the road and signalled the oncoming
          racer. The latter, who had already aeon the
          blockade, flowed up, and gave the wreck a
          wide berth. Benjamin shouted for him to send
          on an ambulance from Queens, and seventeen
          minutes after Tarte passed, the ambulance of
          St. Mary's Hospital arrived, with Dr. <;. A.
          Fenesterer. visiting surgeon of the Nassau Hos
          pital. Menzel was covered with blood, and it
          was thought that he was severely cut. Dr.
          Fenesterer examined him carefully and saw
          that he had a fracture of the base of the skull,
          and that he could not live.
          Arents had apparently been thrown from his
          place on the driver's seat before the machine
          went over, and escaped being caught under it.
          He was stunned to unconsciousness by the fall.
          The injured >T»en were taken to Nassau 11"-
          pital, in Hempstead, where the machinist died
          at 11:30 a. m. The machine was thrown out of
          the way at the roadside, where it was the centre
          of interest for a curious crowd until the race was
          ended.
          At the Nassau County Hospital last night it
          was said that the condition of George Arents,
          Jr., was very serious. He has a fracture at the
          base of the skull and is suffering from "cerebral
          hemorrhages. He is unconscious, and his con
          dition is such that it will be impossible, the doc
          tors say, to perform an operation to-night. His
          chances of recovery art* considered not to be
          good. Dr. McCosh. Mr. Arents's family physi
          cian, and Dr. Lam-hart, the hospital physician,
          are in attendance. The injured man's, father,
          mother and brother are at his bedside.
          The place where the wreck occurred was on
          the stretch of the Hempstc-ad Turnpike that lies
          between the farms of Jerome Van Devere and
          George R. Ludwin. and near the same point, but
          a littie nearer the turn in the road, the French
          machine, designated as "V 2," and driven by A.
          Clement, an hour after the- accident Involving
          "li." made the name waiting diversion from the
          direct course that mark. the loss of the tire on
          Arents's machine, but escaped accident.
          The first news of the accident which happened
          to George Arents, jr.. the young amateur driver,
          and his machinist, was received in this city at
          the office of the American Tobacco Company,
          No. 11l Fifth-avr-., when the Injured man's wife
          telephoned to George Arents, isr., who is a large
          stockholder in the American Tobacco Company.
          Mr. Arer.ts called up the Nassau Hospital to in
          quire about his son, but had hardly spoken a
          word when be dropped the telephone receiver
          and started Immediately for the hospital.
          Mr. Arents had heard a rumor that another
          contestant, who was trying to pass the machine
          his son was piloting, had been injured and that
          his son had escaped Injury. "I'm sure." said the
          father, "that George could not have been hurt
          trying to ra*s anybody. He's too cautious for
          that."
          It was reported that the injured man's mother
          was ill and that all news of the accident was
          withheld from her.
          THRONGS AT THE RACE.
          Early Morning Start Fails to Daunt
          the Thousands.
          Friday night was a wonderful nisht for that
          section of Long island through which the race
          course went. There waa an influx of visitors
          such as that staid neighborhood probably never
          has seen before -visitors who thronged every
          hotel aad lodging bouse, visitors who pre-empt
          ed every available room In the farmers' houses,
          and slept on shakedowns in the parlors, visitors
          NEW- YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. SUNDAY. OCTOBER 9. 1904
          who slept in the barrooms on cots, and visitors
          who slept not at all.
          To this (rreat throng was ndded another as
          large, which journeyed to the racecourse by
          special trains, leaving this city at unearthly
          periods in the small hours. Across the Thlrty
          fourth-st. ferry travelled hundreds of big tour
          inp cars, their occupants swathed In furs and
          ats. over the sandy Long Island roads,
          • daybreak, automobiles of every size
          and complexion travelled, snorting, contemptu
          ously Hinginß the i>< bbles out on the mere pedes
          trians who trudged sturdily along toward West
          bury.
          It was heyday for whatever farmer had any
          klinJ of travelling conveyance for hire. Horses
          beyond the pension limit drew vehicles
          equally as antiquated, tilled to the utmost with
          automobile enthusiasts, from the railroad sta
          to the starting point. Disputing the roads
          with th<-m were everywhere the lordly auto
          s, tli^ir humble cousins the motorcycles,
          and the plebeian bicycles. Smart traps there
          with th'Mr smart occupants, the women
          burying their i^ink cheeks in heavy furs.
          I-'iiiß l»efi>re daybreak th.« starting point at
          Westbury was the focus of activity. Toward it
          gravitated sll the vteltora. Th»- roads for a
          couple "f miles in each direction were choked
          with automobiles and carriage-*. Huge touring
          cars grumbled in deep ba»s>. hM'- by side with

          stand or previously selected vantage points
          along the road.
          Gradually the great bare grandstand began to
          fill. Dainty women in winter furs, their escorts
          wearing heavy overcoats and fur gloves, came
          from the cars along the roadway. Later arri
          vals hurried Into places, intent on seeing the
          departure of the very first machine. Down
          on the track long-, lean racing cars, gaunt steel
          frameworks of almost sinister aspect, quivered
          and snorted, their driven, beyond recognition.
          In their greatcoats, caps and dust glasses, bend
          iiiiK over them with affectionate regard, care
          fully Inspecting every part of the mechanism
          from which they expected so much In the race.
          Over in the Judges' stand telephone bells
          Jingled, bringing reports from special agents at
          every part of the track. A little knot of Judges
          and track 0.11*.. ..is gathered In momentary con
          ferences, dissolved that its members might
          visit entrants, foregather with perturbed driv
          ers, hustle. l obstructing sightseers off the track
          and picked up the thousand and one loose ends
          of the momenta immediately before the start
          of the great race.
          William K. Vanderbilt, jr.. In his automobile
          cap and great fur coat, seemed to be every
          where. Long before the start he was on the
          ground, arranging the detail*. He it was who
          gave the signal, Just at 0 o'clock, when the
          first car, Btevens*s big Mercedes, had been
          poshed up to the tap*-, that started it down the
          course, leaping ahead to the plaudit* of the
          grandstand and the shouts of the throng which
          lined the roadway. He it was who superintended
          every detail of the starling of each subsequent
          car. He It was who kept in closest touch with
          the judges' stand and the bulletins which were
          received there; he who peremptorily waved
          back the excited throng which rushed over the
          track Immediately after each car passed, and
          he jumped into a waiting car and, calling a
          physician, drove like the wind down to Queens
          when word came of the accident to Mr. Arents.
          As the morning began to acquire strength, the
          throng of spectators In the grandstand filled it
          to its utmost capacity. Fully half the number
          were women, most of whom had been there
          when the race began. It wan a healthy, clean
          cut lot, who testified by their keen interest the
          love they bore for outdoor sports. As the sun
          came up, furs began to disappear, and veils
          thrust back disclosed flower hats. Prominent
          in the front seat wan Mrs. W. K. Vanderbilt. Jr.,
          who keenly followed the race, and when the
          struggle between Heath and Clement became
          dose sprang to her feet to cheer the American
          each time he plunged past the grandstand.
          TROUBLES AT JERICHO.
          Loosened Tires and Nail Bestrewn
          Course Cause Many Mishaps.
          Although It had been expected that Jericho
          Turnpike, with Its sharp, ugly turn, would
          prove the principal scene of any mishaps that
          might occur, not a single accident due to the
          (urve happened here in the entire rice. Xon*
          the less, the historic turnpike was again and
          again the scene of popping tiren. A number of
          short unrustcd nails that were found strewn on
          the- surface of the petroleum soaked earth at
          the steepest portion of the curve might have
          accounted for the punctured tiree. a thre«
          minutes' search within a radius of live yards
          disclosed the presence of seven of these, nails,
          bestrewn on tho centre of the track, that »«emed
          to indicate a deliberate attempt to wreck the
          racing machines. The track wa* carefully In
          spected lnte on Friday, and it is believed that
          the nails were strewn over the road where they
          ml^ht do the most damage, some time In the
          night.
          in ibe first hour of the race no leu than four
          machines had trouble with their tiree at Jericho.
          "vTally" Owens, an automobile driver, found a
          number of these nails scattered on the turnpike.

          A fair Instance of the v.ay in which the specta- .
          tors regarded the contestants and the manner in
          which these accepted their reverses occurred at
          this turnpike Just before 9:30 a. m. S. B.
          Stevens. Jr.'s, 60- horsepower Mercedes car (No..
          1), driven by Campbell, had punctured a tire,
          and Campbell;' in a fury of haste, had- leaped
          from the car. with his mechanic, to rip the tire
          from the wheel and substitute a new one.
          As Campbell stooped down to examine the tire
          a pretty, well dressed woman. In the • crowd
          seemed to recognize him, despite his dirty over
          alls and his face that was her* black spotted
          with oil. here caked with viscid mud. ;
          "O Mr. Campbell," she pleaded, gazing at
          the flattened tire, "why don't you give It up?
          You've done splendidly, and we shouldn't like
          any accident to happen."
          "What's the use?" said Campbell, cheerfully,
          grinning through the mud. "We've still one tire
          left." . "
          "Can we give you something to eat? asked
          half a dozen spectators at once, bringing out. ap
          parently from nowhere, sundry bottles of beer
          and paper wrapped sandwiches.
          "Thanks; I have some," replied Campbell, pro
          ducing with one hand a square of chocolate.

          which he proceeded to nJbbl*. wrenching at the
          tire with the other hand, all the while making
          anxious Inquiries as to the fat© of rival cars.
          It was as William Wallace's IK)- horsepower
          Flat w.'u! rounding the turn at Jericho on the
          first lap of the race that the first real accident
          occurred. Wallace, who was his own driver,
          discovered that the machine hrtd been fed too ;
          much oil. and the engine had become clogged.
          Tony Antony, the Italian mechanic. Jumped
          down, and, after two minutes' delay, succeeded
          In remedying th« trouble. Wallace restarted
          the engine, bat Antony in making a flying leap
          to board the now moving car, missed his foot
          ing, ami was dragged for several yards under
          the near rear wheel Another mechanic, how
          ever, who was standing close' by, succeeded in
          '^aplng aboard the car, which went off with a
          rasa, and was quickly out of sifiht.
          Antony was carried into an adjoining repair
          tent, and was Immediately stripped and exam
          ined. It was found, however, that no bones
          were broken, and that the injuries were not of
          a serious character.
          Wormaer'a car burst a tire while rounding the
          turn at J.ili ho, but after a delay of thirty sec
          onds It went on with a Oat tire without waiting

          Probably one of the most Interested spectators
          at the race was Mayor McCleUan. He cam« to the
          starting line at Westbury in an automobile, and
          as he waited up to the stand with Street Commis
          sioner Wootlbury a constable lav up to him and
          tried to force him oft tin* court

          the stand? That's Mayor McClellan."
          "Is that so?" replied th.- constable. "Well. 1
          seen my duty and done it."
          K. E. Bawley, who ran K. R. Thomas's bis; car.
          was the first driver out of the race to appear at the
          grandstand^ He was feeling rather melancholy,
          but he explained that th-- springs' oh his machine
          had broken, and by the time he could replace them
          he would assuredly be out of tho running. "I
          guess I had about a 1 to GOO chance, anyhow." he
          said.. "I didn't seem to measure up against some
          of the other cars, with their bis horsepower. The
          course to-day was simply great. I've got abso
          lutely no fault to. llnd with the track, or the way
          In which It was patrolled. 1 passed other cars at
          what I consider the two worst places on the
          course — at the Queens turn and where the road had
          been lowered to .-;>• under a railway. In th.-se
          pluces, the narrowest ami worst. I had plenty of
          room to pass. There was . not a bit of QUSt any
          where. Only once was I bothered by people on the
          course. Once or twice I saw people in carriages
          ahead of me but they turned off the track before I
          came anywhere near them."
          Immediately after the rae*. William K. Vander
          bllt, Jr.. "vas almost overwhelmed by the rush of
          people to congratulate him. He had been one of
          the. busleat men on the course, and showed In his
          glad smile and buoyant manner how pleased he
          was with the result of the race. "Yes, I'm glad an
          American won it," be sairl. "Of course, the ?con
          ditions on which the cup was given provide that
          the race be held in Ibis country next year also
          but I hop« the cup will ••tay here for a long time!
          I think the course was good— fully as good as

          By John B. Foster.
          NEW YORK. Saturday,
          September 15. 1900.
          For the third successive year the annual
          contest by motor cars for the Vanderbilt
          cup will be held this fall over the course
          on Long Island, on Saturday, October 0.
          Prior to that, on Saturday. September 22,
          the ellmlnatory trials, to decide which of
          the American cars shall compete against
          the foreign cars, will be held over the same
          course.
          Fifteen cars will compete In the elimina
          tion trial. Among them are some of the
          best-known automobiles which are made In
          the United States, and several makers who
          have never entered before will try this year
          to find a place among the elect for the
          grand race on October 6.
          For the Vanderbilt cup there will be four
          teams, representing Germany. Italy, France
          and the United States. The French and
          Italian teams will be represented by five
          cars, the German by three and the Amer
          lean by five. Of course. It 1b Impossible to I
          tell what five will represent the United
          States until after September 22.
          The distance around the course Is 29..">
          miles In round numbers. That may not be
          quite the fractional figure, but it Is correct
          enough to give the reader an Idea of the
          mileage that must be traversed on each lap
          of the course. As all cars which finish must
          make ten laps, both In the elimination and
          cup race*. It Is apparent that about 29o
          miles will have to be run before a motor
          car can hope to be honored by merely fin
          ishing the required distance, which has
          proved in the past no mean task.
          May Be Some Fast Trips.
          It is barely possible that the course will
          occasionally be taken in thirty minutes. It
          will depend largely upon the condition of
          the rSads and the ability of the cars to sur
          mount two rather steep hills which have
          been Included in this year's route, but which
          have never been a test in the race before.
          Ten laps *t unlimited "Speed would mean
          three hundred minutes of time, or about
          five hours. It is not at all probable that
          the race will be run tliat quickly, as that
          Is the minimum limit, and there will be de
          lays because of tire trouble and because of
          other accidents of more or less moment
          which may happen to some of the cars, but
          It would not be surprising if the contest
          were finished In about six hours. If some
          machine Is fortunate enough to run through
          In good condition. Those that scale walls
          or smash into telegraph poles will be num- ,
          bered with the "also started." !
          A motor car race over highways which
          are partially adapted to It Is the most
          thrilling contest imaginable tn all sport. If
          It were possible to conceive an oval race
          track with a circumference of thirty miles, j
          with eighteen locomotives running upon It
          at the rate of sixty miles an hour, trying
          to pass one another at times and taking all
          manner of risks to do so. a conception
          would be had of what a motor car race is I
          like.
          Were a track to be specially built for j
          that sort of thing, however, it would be j
          free of haz irds. such as wicked turns. Btone
          walls on curves, telegraph poles inoppor
          tunely placed where a sliding car would
          be likely to catch its axle and throw the
          unfortunate driver and mechanician to al
          most certain death, low embankments over
          which a car speeding at full rate would be
          likely to plunge and railroad crossings,
          which act somewhat like a springboard and
          give a speeding motor an upward Jump and
          a forward plunge of four or five feet. All
          manner of things like this happen on the
          Long Island circuit, and yet it is considered
          to be a tolerably fair course, as natural
          highways go.
          A Hobby of the Rich.
          When the first Vanderbilt cup race was
          liehl In the United 8tates a great many
          people thought that it was rich men's
          pastime and not poor men's pleasure. There
          was some opposition to it on Long Island,
          but. as It happens, most of the race runs
          through the property of those who favor
          that sort of thing, and when it came to a
          test before the county officials the race car
          ried the day, except on the part of one su
          pervisor, and his vote was not enough to
          Induce the people of the Immediate section
          to hold a mass meeting to protest against it.
          Two or three weeks before the race was
          actually run there began to be such a de
          mand for accommodations about ail the
          iection in and around Garden City and
          Hempstead that whatever opposition had
          existed to the race was abandoned. The
          residents found that the first gold mine In
          the history of their lives had suddenly
          opened at their very feet.
          The novelty of a motor car race, the fact
          that some men of great prominence were
          to drive cars In the contest and the further
          fact that foreign countries had sent across
          the ocean their best automobiles and their
          most famous drivers to compete aroused
          such Interest on the part of thousands who
          never had ridden In an automobile, and
          probably never would be able to own one,
          that they journeyed twenty-five miles Into
          the Interior of the Island hours before day
          break to be present at the start.
          At the First Bace.
          Perhaps 100.000 persons saw the first race
          run. They were scattered from one end of
          the course to the other, and In the larger
          villages crowded about It to such an ex
          tent that the officials had some difficulty
          In keeping them off the road. They did not
          seem to be aware of the fact that they
          were getting In the way of machines which
          would run at times from sixty to seventy
          five miles an hour.
          When the second race took place. In the
          fall of 1905, the people of Long Island were
          wiser. Prices had doubled over those of the
          former year, and the prices of 1904 had
          been quadrupled over what usually was#
          asked for accommodations.
          The railroad, which had a monopoly of
          taking people to the start, advertised two
          excursion trains for 4 o'clock In the morn
          ing. They expected that they might carry
          J about 1,600 spectators. At 3 o'clock In the
          morning the station of the railroad was a
          sight. It was so Jammed with excursionists
          that it was Imperative upon the company
          | to make up a train as quickly as possible
          to get them out of the way and permit
          others to take their places.
          One train followed another until day
          light, and there were passengers packed
          in every square foot of the cars. They
          filled the platforms, choked the aisles, clung
          to the backs of seats and even rode on the
          tenders and the cowcatchers of the locomo
          tives. The railroad people were astounded
          at the tremendous Interest which was taken
          in the race, and the conductors gave up the
          | task of collecting tickets and trusted to
          getting them on the return home.
          Quarter of a Million Sightseers.
          It is estimated that 250.000 persons saw
          i the contest of 11HI5. Some of them were at
          I Mlneola, a place of some consequence in the
          Hempstead district of the island; some were
          ; far out In the country, where they had
          | journeyed the night before, selecting some
          i particular spot where there was more or
          ; less danger in making a turn and where
          they expected to see something thrill ng be
          fore the day was over, while thousands of
          others distributed themselves along the
          north side of the route, where the road is
          winding and the country more or less un
          dulating.
          How many will see the cup race this year
          Is a question. Owing to the general interest
          which Is taken in the event there are many
          people who predict that half a million spec
          tatorn will be scattered over the thirty miles
          of road. That is doubtless exaggerated, but
          it would not be surprising if 300,000 persons
          witness some part of the race if the day is
          pleasant.

          on the following morning in their own cars.
          Until midnight the magnificent highways
          and boulevards when run to the center of
          the island are filled with hundreds of motor
          cars, "honking" more or less rapidly
          through the darkness, the.r great lights
          glowing over the plains like the eyes of
          enormous beetles prowling in the gloom

          where they are conveyed to the Long Island
          side.

          Ing on as fast a schedule as they could, yet
          there was no time on the New York side
          until very late In the morning that there
          was not a line of motor cars which ex
          tended for a distance of half a mile from
          the ferry house, their owners patiently
          awaiting their turn to get across the river.
          Some gave up the ferry in despair and hur
          ried through the city down to the Brooklyn
          bridge and tried other roads on Long Island
          to get to the scene of the race.
          At the Garden City Hotel the scene is one
          which has no equal in the United States-,
          except during the day and evening prior to
          a cup race. The air is fairly filled with
          the hoarse trumpetings of the cars or the
          sonorous and sometimes high-pitched sirens,
          which drone forth warnings as they near
          the sharper turns of the roads or turn their
          way into the capacious yard of the hotel.
          The parlors, corridors and offices of the
          hotel are filled with a gay set. Women
          clad In the most fashionable of evening
          gowns recline In lounging chairs listening
          to the hotel orchestra. Fresh arrivals
          brush past them dressed In outing garb
          Just as they have come from the olty. Some
          men are dressed for dinner. Others wear
          their leather or linen automobile coats, and
          faces and hands still bear the traces of
          the thick clouds of dust through which they
          have driven. The capacious dining room is
          filled with a great crowd, which does not
          begin to diminish until midnight. But
          everywhere and above all are constantly
          heard the hoarse calls of the motor cars,
          which are still traversing the country roads
          in the thick darkness.
          Minutes for Sleep.
          By 1 o'clock In the morning comparative
          quiet settles over the place. The sirens of
          the motor cars still screech, but the ear be
          comes accustomed to them and their un
          musical whistling is unnoticed. The hotel
          assumes the appearance of a gigantc bar
          racks. Everywhere are scattered cots for
          the weary to lie down for a few minutes of
          rest. Except where some wealthy man has
          been able to engage a suite of rooms for the
          exclusive use of his invited guests, porters
          have been busy filling the hotel rooms with
          cots and Improvised beds, and It Is not un
          common for six and seven or more to oc
          cupy a room.
          The night is short lived. At 3 o'clock the
          servants of the hotel are busy rushing
          through the corridors awakening the sleep
          ing guests, If any have been able to snatch
          a few minutes, sleep, and at 4 o'clock break
          fast of some pretensions Is served In the
          dining room, which is soon thickly crowded
          Tke V^.wAer'bil_t
          Cxxp.
          with sleepy motorists, whose half-closed
          eyes belie their attempt at jollity. The
          women, as a rule, appear decidedly more
          fresh than the men. Their evening gowns
          have been laid aside for smart automobile
          costumes, and they seem to be far more im
          pressed with the excitement orf the occasion
          than their male escorts, most of whom are
          more accustomed to arising at 8 o'clock in
          the morning thr.n three hours before sun
          rise.
          With breakfast finished there is another
          rush and whirl of the motor cars, and the
          drowsy guests are whisked away to the
          start by sharp-eyed chauffeurs, who must
          exercise great care while traveling through
          the gloom and morning mist to avoid colli
          sions or running down some unfortunate
          motorist whose rear signal lights, poorly
          trimmed before starting away, have been
          blown out in the fresh morning breeze.
          Where the Race Is Bun.
          This particular part of Long Island, over
          which the motor cars are allowed to be
          speeded at the hearts' content of their own
          ers: Just borders on that section of Hemp
          stead Plain which A. T. Stewart, the mil
          lionaire dry goods merchant of New York
          once alluded to as the "garden spot of the
          east."
          He was not far wrong, for the soil of
          Long Island is so fertile that it takes only
          a planting, a shower and a bit of sunlight
          to raise a crop of something or other. It
          may be weeds, but they grow with a lux
          urious rankness which is almost tropical.
          The start and finish of the race will be at
          a point near Mlneola. The first time that
          it was run the start was located away down
          toward Westbury. It was a delight for the
          elect who live in that vicinity, as they had
          but a short distance to motor to reach the
          grand stand. It made quite an exclusive
          society event of the affair?so exclusive, in
          fact, that some of the owners of the cars
          which competed were unable to get to the
          start because the roads were closed against
          them before they could travel from the city
          or from Long Island hotels where they had
          spent the night. It was respectfully sug
          gested before the next race that the start
          be placed somewhere to accommodate the
          common people, who had evinced a lot of
          curiosity in the affair and who were entitled
          to a little consideration. It was also sug
          gested that, inasmuch as the makers were
          spending the money to build the motor
          cars, it was but fair that they shotrid get a
          sight of the start and finish.
          Hence the grand stand was moved to a
          point near Mineola, where everybody
          seemed to be satisfied except the drivers of
          the cars, who complained that American
          curiosity was such that scores of persons
          hugged the tracks where they had no busi
          ness to be and kept the chauffeurs in con
          stant fear of some accident, like a loosened
          tire or broken steering gear, which would
          cause a car to swerve and run Into the
          crowd, killing scores Indiscriminately.
          Not Far From Mineola.
          The start this year will be near Mineola,
          but it will be farther east than it was in
          1905, probably just beyond the crossing of
          the Oyster Bay branch of the Long Island
          railroad, which is seen in the accompanying
          map of the route.
          From the time the start is left until East
          Norwich is readied the cars fairly burn
          the surface of the road. Their route is
          along the Jericho turnpike, a* splendidly
          macadamized road, which has but few un
          dulations in its surface and mostly traverses
          a region so level that the pleasure seeker
          passing along at less than a madman's
          pace is able to see the gre-n-clad country
          side for some miles wherever the shrubbery
          is low enough to permit an outlook over the
          land.
          At Jericho, which Is a few miles along
          the level plain, the road trends toward the
          northeast, In the direction of Oyster Bay,
          where President Roosevelt makes his sum
          mer home. In fact, when it arrives at East
          Norwich it is not so far from the President
          that one could not drive to his comfortable
          cottage in a little over an hour.
          This road, like the Jericho turnpike, Is
          splendidly macadamized, but It Is a trifle j
          more rolling, and there are some bends and j
          turns which make It rather difficult for the
          driver of a car speeding at the rate of sixty
          miles an hour to see more than one hundred
          yards ahead of him.
          First Bad Turn.
          At East Norwich there is the first real
          "up-and-down mean turn" of the course.
          The car, with its speed of sixty miles an
          hour or more, must be kept sufficiently I
          under control to round a sharp curve to the
          left. If it should happen to get away from
          the driver it would very likely land in the
          front door of the village tavern, which faces
          the road at just the right angle to receive
          it as an invited guest. In fact, it is told, no
          one vouching for the accuracy of the yarn,
          however, that when the French drivers were
          first practicing over the course a year ago
          one of them did land his machine on the
          veranda of the hotel, gave the landlord a
          wild greeting with the popping of the ex
          thaust from the cylinders and backed down
          and away before the curious villagers could
          get to the scene to congratulate him upon
          not battering the hotel down.
          After the turn is made the cars have a
          straightaway stretch over another splen
          didly macadamized road to Bull's Head
          Tavern. Western people will be interested
          to learn that most of the roads over which
          the race is run are as hard as if paved and
          quite as smooth as if they were asphalted.
          They are simply delightful to ride upon,
          even In wet weather, and graciously com
          fortable all the year around.
          This run to Bull's Head Tavern Is over
          country a trifle more undulating than that
          which was traversed on the southern side
          of the course, but there is no danger at
          ar.y time in navigating the hills, and the
          cars take the declines and the ascends at
          full speed.
          At Bull's Head there is a particularly
          vicious turn, almost at right angles to the
          left. The manner in which most of the pro
          fessional drivers take It is this: They cpme
          up to the corner almost at full speed. There
          they begin to clap on the brakes. Their
          mechanicians swing far out over the left
          side of the machine, somewhat like outrig
          gers to a sailing craft, and checking the
          speed, and at the same time throwing the
          steering gear around, the cars are "skidded"
          about the curve until their prows, so to
          speak, are pointed directly down the course,
          and then they are off again full tilt for the
          next dangerous spot.
          The point on the Vanderbilt cup course of
          this year which will command the most at
          tention from-the sensationalists, who are
          always looking for something hair-lifting to
          happen, is near Old Westbury. It has been
          christened the "hairpin turn," and the name
          has not been badly applied.
          It Is a sharp curve, In which the road
          practically bends back upon itself, and will
          have to be negotiated with some care if a
          driver does not want to smash into a tele
          graph pole or climb a fence into a corn

          field. And, by the way. th8t happened at
          one point of the course last year. In rush*
          lng along Willetts road one of the French
          drivers lost control of his car. which
          "skidded" Into a corn field, and there It re
          mained until the race was over.
          This hairpin turn Is like nothing mora
          than a letter "U." It is entered upon the
          left-hand side, approaching the opening ot
          the "U." Before the driver reaches It tha
          road slants a trifle from the east, and woe
          betide the unlucky wight who approaches
          the turn unconscious that It Is In his lmme
          diate proximity. He may speed half a mlla
          or more before he Is able to control his ma
          chine so that he can turn around and re
          cover his lost ground.
          In the direct center of the curve of tha
          "U" there Is located a telegraph pole. It
          a car ever "skids" from the road and
          strikes that pole, not only will the car ba
          shattered, but there will be no telegraphing
          or telephoning in that part of Long Island
          for some hours.
          If the car la not sufficiently under control
          to make the reverse side of the "U" In
          perfect marching order It Is apt to climb a
          fence and dart upon a ploughed field.
          After the turn is rounded in safety tha
          road stretches away over some finely laid
          macadam, back of Roslyn, to another sharp
          curve banked on the north side by a stone
          wall. This is a particularly short and mean
          turn, and there Is danger of accident. In
          that a car which happens to be stalled on
          the far side is likely to be run into by a
          pursuing car, whose driver inay not perceive
          the obstruction In time.
          Severest Test of All Years.
          From here until the road turns toward tha
          Manhasset turnpike the highway Is very
          narrow, although It Is In fair condition as
          regards surface. On the Manhasset turn
          pike the 10 per cent hill which runs through
          Manhasset village must be descended and
          surmounted, and this Is by far the severest
          test which has ever been imposed upon
          motor cars In any race which has been held
          for the Vanderbilt cup.
          To take this hill at full speed and climb It
          means some rare generalship, and will
          necessitate a machine which can stand the
          grind ten times In succession. Just beyond
          Manhasset the road turns sharply to tha
          left and passes over a well-kept turnpike
          to the beautiful property of William K.
          Vanderbilt, Jr.. the donor of the cup. who
          resides at Lakevllle.
          At Lakeville there Is another turn to the
          left, where the route goes over the Wllletta
          road to the east. This was traversed by
          the old cup route In 1905 and will be used
          .as far as Willis avenue, where the car*
          turn sharply to the right, retrace their way
          to Mineola and the Jericho turnpike and
          then to the starting point.
          Almost all of the Vanderbilt cup route
          traverses a region in which beautiful sum
          mer homes are the rule. The whole are.-*
          Is covered with magnificent groves and
          beautiful shrubbery. The estates of tha
          wealthy are laid out with rate concern to
          perfect landscape gardening, and In many
          places the qu.et highways and lanes remind
          one much of the beautiful rural regions in
          England during the month of June. It is
          a most charming country to the eye. and
          there is no end ot pleasure in taking a trip
          over the cup route merely for the delightful
          outing.
          Foreign Cars Favorites.
          In every year in which the race has been
          run the foreign cars have been the favor
          ites. In advance of the running of thl?
          year's race they are again the favorites.
          Of course. It is the ambition of the Amer
          ican builders to manufacture a car which
          shall surpass those sent here by France,
          Germany and Italy. Both years the French
          makers have been fortunate enough to win
          the Vanderbilt cup. In 1904 a Panhard wa?
          the successful car and In 1905 the race was
          won by a Darracq.
          Last year the Americans finished third la
          the race, the Locomobile, operated by Jo
          seph Tracy, surpassing all that had been
          anticipated from the car. This year the
          American makers are satisfied that from
          the cars which are to be raced in the elim?
          lnatlon trials five will be selected which
          shall make a better showing than the Amer
          ican cars ever have made in the past, and
          they are greatly In hope that they may be
          able to finish first.
          The value of the cars which are to com
          pete in the Vanderbilt race Is about half a
          million dollars. They are driven by ex
          perts, whose salaries are higher than those
          of any other chauffeurs in the world. They
          are not valueless for anything but racing,
          as many suppose, but most of them are used
          for racing and racing only.
          The object in encouraging racing Is so to
          Improve the construction of cars that light*
          ness shall go with stability and durability,
          and that manufacturers may know how best
          to use materials In order to produce tha
          most satisfactory results in the longevity
          of road cars. Machines which can stand
          the test of road racing will almost cer
          tainly last longer and do better work on
          the road If the same principles are followed
          in building them for the use of those who
          purchase automobiles both for ? amusement
          and practical purposes. Hence the value
          of a cup race is not solely that of making
          wonderful records and setting two con
          tinents aghast by the terrific speed at which
          the cars are driven, but In deriving benq*
          flclal Information from results so as to lm?
          prove the construction of the cars which
          are used in commerce and for pleasure.

          The Car That Won
          riHi
          The Locomobile International Racer that won th Vanderblit
          cup will be exhibited In Omaha today and the rest of the week at
          J. J. Derlght'a.
          Thla 1b the first American car to achieve aupreme triumph.
          An American Car designed by an American, built by Americana
          In an American factory of American material and driven by an
          American.
          Thla race waa a teat of reliability and endurance, and In spite
          of a slippery course, the 258 mtlea were covered at an average speed
          of 64.3 mllea per hour. Pretty fast when you figure It at 4 feet a
          aecond.
          The New "30"
          The name Locomobile guaranteed superiority. The new "30"
          ahaft driven la strong, durable and above all, easy riding. Another
          feature not to be overlooked, la simple control, when studying power.
          In that race the tiocnmnhlle was obligee!
          to travel at the rate of M.S miles an hour
          for miles to win the cup. and at times
          In the stralxhtnaay stretches It aslon
          l.hed the half million spectators by mnln
          tslntng a upeeri greater than 100 miles an
          hour. Had there been no dangerous turns
          In the course, necessitating a reduction In
          speed to as low as thirty-five and forty
          miles an hour for short stretches, the Loco
          mobile would have averaged at least eighty
          miles an hotir for the entire route.
          The winning of the Vanderbl.t cup by
          an American car for the first time hxs
          added much to the reputation df American
          automobile builders In general, as well aa
          to the makers of the Ijocomohlle, and from
          the hour the race was won up to the pres
          ent time there has been unusual curiosity
          to see the locomobile racer No. It
          has been exhibited In several eastern cities
          before crowds of curious visitors, but a

          demand came from the weat as well, and
          It was determined to display It in all the
          large cities weat of the Mississippi river.
          After being shown in Omaha it will be
          taken to Kansas City.
          In appearance the big racing car does
          not differ veryn atari ally from the re ru

        <text>DARE-DEVIL DRIVER RALPH DE PALMA AGAIN
          WINS FAMOUS VANDERBILT CUP RACE
          Balph De Palma in a Mercedes car
          winning the Vanderbilt cup race at
          Santa Monica, Cal. The picture was
          snapped just as De Palma crossed the
          finishing line and Flagman Warner is
          shown in the foreground signaling
          the end of the race. This is the sec
          ond time this famous driver has won
          this event, having carried away the
          same honor last year. De Palma
          made the 294 miles in 3 hours 51 min
          utes and 41 seconds. Although his
          average speed was 75 miles an hour,
          still De Palma didn't break any speed
          record. He did, however, break an
          endurance record by running the en
          tire race without a stop. His time on
          the straightaway was as high as 90
          miles an hour, while on the Nevada
          Curve he slowed down to 30. The
          entire purse for the event was $7;500,
          of which De Palma won $3,000. The
          lower picture of De Palma was taken
          just after he won the race. Barney
          Oldfield ran a close second, finishing
          200 yards behind the famous Italian
          driver. His share of the purse was
          $2,000. The remainder was divided
          between the other winners, Carlson,
          who finished third, got $1,500, while
          Cooper, in fourth place, took $1,000.
          Of the 15 cars that started only five
          finished. The race was phenomenal
          for number of accidents and lack of
          fatalities. Eddie Pullen, who led the
          race, went 14 laps at the appalling
          rate of 85 miles per hour and then
          on the fatal Nevada avenue curve
          blew out a tire and ran into the fence,
          wrecking his oar. But he miracul
          ously escaped injury.

          RACE ON TODAY
          AT EXPOSITION
          EXPOSITION GROUNDS, San
          Francisco, Feb. 22. —One hun
          dred and fifty thousand sped, Horn
          gathered at the Panama-Pacific
          exposition grounds here enrly to
          day to witness the Vanderbilt
          enp race—America, automobile
          road classic The race was unique
          In several respects. It was the
          first time a road Tace was ever
          held over an entire enclosed
          course and it also was the first
          time that a big automobile con
          teat was ever staged on exposi
          tion grounda.
          The distance to be covered by
          drivers today was 294.062 miles.
          There were 76 laps to the race,
          each lap representing 3.905S
          miles. The crack driven of
          America and four other coun
          tries were represented in the race.
          There were 16 entries, but Ralph
          De Palma, twice winner of the
          Vanderbilt cup, driving a Mor
          eadea car, was the favorite In the
          betting. De Palma purchased hia
          ear abroad last fall and it we*
          a money winner in the Grand
          Prix of France last year. If De
          Palma won today's race he would
          attain permanent possession of
          the Vanderbilt trophy and In
          ■uch an event the Vanderbile cup
          race would be removed from the
          Hat of road racing classics.
          The course itself was unique,
          laatead of racing over macadam
          —_■ the Vanderbilt racers did at
          Dong Island and at Elgin—Ute

          three-quarters of a mile at one
          end, where the course made use
          of part of a mile track, designed
          for horse racing. The start and
          finish were to be made on th
          inile track. From either side of
          this modified oval the course was
          routed through a mate of state
          and foreign nation buildings. The
          straight stretches enclosed most
          of the exposition's main build

          In addition to Carlson and De

        <text>AUTO MEN PROPOSE
          REVIVAL OF RACING
          Plan to Renew Vanderbilt Cup
          and Grand Prize Events
          on Old Course.
          Retval of the famous Vanderbilt
          and Grand Prize automobile races
          over the historic courses of Westches
          ter or Long Island is proposed by the
          New York Automobile Dealers' Asso
          elation.
          Since the dismantling of the Sheeps
          head Day speedway. New York has
          been without motor racing of any
          kind. Recently, vigorous interest in
          a revival of racing made itself mani
          fest, culminating in the appointment
          of . S. Partridge by the directors of
          the New York Dealers' Association as
          chairman of an executive committee
          to. take charge of a racing program.
          Prospect of success is especially
          favorable, it is believed, 'because of
          thb fact that the dealers' association
          is headed by W. C. Poertner, a racing
